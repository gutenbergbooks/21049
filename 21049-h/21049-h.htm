<h5>UNCLE TOBY'S LETTER</h5>


<p>"What you going to put on your ship,
Ted?"</p>

<p>"Oh, swords and guns and gunpowder and
soldiers. What you going to load on your
ship, Jan?"</p>

<p>"Oranges and lemons and pineapples,"
answered the little girl, who was playing
with her brother at sailing boats in the
brook that ran back of the house. "And
maybe I'll have gold and diamonds and
chocolate cake on my ship, Teddy," went on
Janet Martin.</p>

<p>"If you do I'll be a pirate and sink your
ship! Oh, Jan, let's play that! I'll be a
pirate!"</p>

<p>Teddy Martin jumped up so suddenly
from the bank of the brook, where he was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>
loading his ship with what he called "swords,
guns and gunpowder," that he tipped the
vessel over and the whole cargo was spilled
into the water.</p>

<p>"Oh, look what you did!" cried Janet.
"Your gunpowder will be all wet!"</p>

<p>"I'm not ready to play the pirate game
yet," explained Teddy. "Anyhow, I can get
more powder."</p>

<p>This would be easy enough, it seemed, as
the children were only pretending that
stones, pebbles and bits of sticks were the
cargoes of their toy ships, and, as Teddy had
said, he could easily get more stones. The
brook was filled with them.</p>

<p>"Where are you going?" Janet called
after her brother, as she saw him hurrying
toward the house, which was out of sight behind
the trees and bushes that grew on the
edge of the brook.</p>

<p>"I'm going to get a black flag so I can be
a pirate and sink your ship with gold, diamonds
and chocolate cakes on!" answered
Teddy over his shoulder as he ran on.</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I don't guess I want you to be a pirate,"
said Janet slowly, as she looked at
her ship, on which the pebbles, stones and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>
bits of wood were neatly arranged in piles.
"I'm not going to play that game! I don't
want you to be a pirate, Ted! It's too
scary!"</p>

<p>But her brother was beyond the reach of
her voice now, hurrying toward the house
after his "black pirate flag." Janet shoved
her ship out from the shore&mdash;her ship laden
with diamonds, gold and chocolate cakes.
Of course it was not a real ship. The Curlytops
would not have had half as much fun
with real ships as they were having with the
pieces of boards which they were making believe
were steamers and sailing vessels.</p>

<p>"I'll sail my ship away down to the end
of the brook before Ted gets back to be a
pirate," said Janet to herself, as, with a long
stick, she directed the flat board which was
piled high with brook-pebbles. "Then when
he comes back he can't sink it."</p>

<p>Janet pushed her ship slowly at first, and
then a little faster, moving it along by means
of the stick while she stood on the bank.
Then, hearing a noise in the bushes behind
her, she thrust harder on the stick.</p>

<p>"I don't want Teddy to pirate my ship!"
she thought. "I'll fool him! I'll sail it
around the bend, and then I'll hide behind<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
the big buttonball tree and he won't know
where I've gone!"</p>

<p>In order to do this Janet wanted to make
her ship go as fast as possible, so she shoved
harder and harder on the stick. And then,
all of a sudden, her ship upset.</p>

<p>With a splash the stones, pebbles and bits
of wood went into the brook. The whole
cargo was sunk and lost as surely as if Ted's
pirate vessel had captured that of his sister.
That is, everything sank but the ship itself
and the cargo of little sticks, some of which
Janet was pretending were chocolate cakes.
Even at that, I suppose, the chocolate cakes
would be wet and soggy. And soggy chocolate
cake isn't good to eat. The best thing
you can do with it is to make it into a pudding.</p>

<p>"Oh, Ted! look what you made me do,"
cried Janet sadly, as she saw the ship, which
she had loaded with such care, capsized and
cleared of its cargo. "It's all your fault!"</p>

<p>And then she started in surprise as a babyish
voice replied:</p>

<p>"I 'idn't do nuffin! I 'ust comed! What's
matter, Jan?"</p>

<p>"Oh, it's you, is it, Trouble?" asked the
girl, as she turned and saw, instead of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
Teddy, her smaller brother William, more
often called "Trouble," because he was in it
so often.</p>

<p>"Yep! Me is here!" announced Trouble.
Sometimes he talked more correctly than
this, and his mother had told Janet and
Teddy to try to cure him of his baby talk
and the wrong use of words. But Ted and
Jan thought it was "cute" to hear Trouble
say queer things, so they did not mend his
talk as often as they might.</p>

<p>"I thought you were Ted," went on Janet.
"Did you see him? He went up to the house
to get a flag."</p>

<p>"Flag," returned Trouble, in a questioning
voice. "Goin' to be soldiers an' have a
'rade?" He meant parade, of course.</p>

<p>"No, we aren't going to have a parade
now, Trouble," said Janet. "Ted went to
get a black flag to be a pirate, so he could
sink my ship that was loaded with diamonds,
gold and chocolate cakes."</p>

<p>"I want chocolate cake&mdash;two pieces!" demanded
Trouble, who had ears only for the
last words of his sister.</p>

<p>"There wasn't any chocolate cake&mdash;really,
dear," explained the little girl, as she ruffled
up her curly hair. "Ted and I were<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
just pretending. He is going to have a pirate
ship. I didn't want him to get mine, so
I was shoving it hard down the brook, but
I made it go too fast and it upset. Now I've
got to load my ship all over again."</p>

<p>"I want s'ip!" demanded William, as Jan
began to guide her empty vessel back to shore
by means of the long stick. "Trouble have
a s'ip?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Yes, you may have a ship, and play with
us," Janet said, and as she was looking about
for a board which might serve her little
brother to play with, she heard someone coming
through the bushes.</p>

<p>"I guess this is Ted," thought Janet.
"Anyhow he can't sink my ship now. I did
it myself."</p>

<p>It was her older brother, and he now came
bursting through the shrubbery that lined
the bank of the brook, holding in his hands
a piece of black cloth.</p>

<p>"I got the pirate flag!" cried Teddy.
"Whoop-la! Now I'm going to sink your
ship! Why, what happened?" he asked, as
he saw that Janet's craft was empty. "Did
Trouble upset it?"</p>

<p>"No, I did it myself," Janet answered.
"But I didn't mean to. I was trying to hide<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
it from you, 'cause I don't want you to be a
pirate and upset my ship full of chocolate
cakes."</p>

<p>"Oh, I must be a pirate! Here's the black
flag and I must be a pirate!" shouted Teddy.
"Whoop! I'm a pirate! I'm a pirate!"</p>

<p>"Hoo! Hoo! Hoop!" yelled Trouble,
trying to make as much noise as his brother.</p>

<p>"You sound more like an Indian than you
do a pirate," said Janet, as she began to
pile more pebbles on the board that was her
ship.</p>

<p>"Well, Indians and pirates are 'most the
same," declared Teddy. "Wait till you see
my ship, with swords and guns and powder!
It will blow your ship out of the water, and
I'll have a black flag on it and everything!
Whoop!"</p>

<p>"I'm not going to play if you upset my
ship, now there!" and Janet pouted her lips
and ceased loading pebbles aboard her craft.</p>

<p>Teddy, who was cutting a flagstaff with
his knife, stopped to look at her. If Janet
was going to act this way, and not send out
her ship, there was no use in being a pirate.
What fun could even a make-believe pirate
have if there were no ships to sink?</p>

<p>Teddy thought of this, and then he said:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span></p>

<p>"All right, Jan, I won't be a pirate if you
don't want me to. But I'll have a black flag,
anyhow, and maybe I'll be a pirate some
other time. Let's have a race with our ships&mdash;see
which one gets to the water-wheel
first."</p>

<p>"Yes, I'll do that," agreed Janet.</p>

<p>At the lower end of the brook she and
Teddy had built a little dam, and where the
water flowed over the top, like a tiny Niagara
Falls, Teddy had fastened a wooden paddle
wheel which turned as the water flowed on it.</p>

<p>"Me want a s'ip!" wailed Trouble, as he
saw his brother and sister getting their vessels
ready for the race.</p>

<p>"Can't you give him a piece of board for
his ship, Ted?" asked Janet. "If we don't
he'll get in our way and spoil the race."</p>

<p>"Here, Trouble, take this," and Teddy
paused long enough in his work of loading
pebbles on his ship to toss his little brother
a small chip he picked up off the shore.</p>

<p>"Hu! I want bigger s'ip 'n' <i>him</i>!" declared
Trouble, with a grunt. Then he arose
and toddled off through the bushes. Teddy
and Janet were so busy getting their own
vessels ready for the coming race that they<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
paid no more attention to their small brother.
And Trouble was going to get into trouble&mdash;you
may be sure of that.</p>

<p>"Don't put too many stones on your ship,
Jan," called Ted to his sister, as he saw that
she was piling on the pebbles.</p>

<p>"Why not?" she asked.</p>

<p>"'Cause you'll make it so heavy that it
won't sail fast. Course I want to beat you,"
Ted went on, "but I want to beat you <i>fair</i>."</p>

<p>"Oh, thank you," Janet answered. "But
these aren't stones I'm loading on my ship
this time."</p>

<p>"What are they?" asked Ted.</p>

<p>"Feathers," his sister answered. "I'm
making believe the stones are feathers, and
I'm going to sell them to make pillows for
dolls. My ship won't be too heavy!"</p>

<p>"Hu!" grunted Ted, as he placed the
pebbles carefully on the middle of his ship,
so it would not turn over. "Stones are
heavy, whether you make believe they're
feathers or not. Don't put too many on, I'm
telling you!"</p>

<p>"All right, I won't," agreed Janet.</p>

<p>The boy and the girl went on with their
game, and they were almost ready to start
their ships off on the race when there was a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
racket in the bushes back of them. It was
a bumping, banging sound that Ted and
Janet heard, then followed the bark of a
dog.</p>

<p>"That's Skyrocket!" said Ted.</p>

<p>A moment later came a voice, calling:</p>

<p>"Whoa-up! Don't go so fas'! You is
spillin' me!"</p>

<p>"That's Trouble!" declared Janet.</p>

<p>They were both right. A moment later
there burst through the bushes the little boy
and the dog. The dog was Skyrocket, and
he was made fast to a box which he was dragging
along by a rope tied around his neck.
Trouble was holding to the rear of the box,
and in his eagerness to pull it along Skyrocket
was also dragging Trouble, "spillin'"
him, in fact&mdash;that is, pulling Trouble
off his feet every now and then.</p>

<p>"Why, William! what are you doing?"
asked Janet. Trouble was hardly ever called
by his right name of William unless he had
done something wrong.</p>

<p>"Were you trying to have Skyrocket ride
you in that box?" asked Teddy. "If you
were, he can't. Sky can't pull you in that
box unless it has wheels on it. Then it's a
wagon."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span></p>

<p>"Don't want wagon&mdash;dis my s'ip!" announced
the little fellow, as he began to
loosen the rope from the dog's neck. But as
soon as Trouble started to do this, Skyrocket,
who loved the children, began to lick
William's face with a red tongue.</p>

<p>"'Top it! 'Top it!" commanded Trouble,
but Skyrocket only licked the more.</p>

<p>"Oh, Ted, unfasten Sky, or he'll eat
Trouble up!" laughed Janet.</p>

<p>"Are you going to sail that big box for
your ship, Trouble?" asked Ted, as he loosed
the dog.</p>

<p>"Yep! Dis box my s'ip," announced the
small boy. "I sail it!"</p>

<p>"Well, don't sail it near ours or you'll upset
our ships&mdash;yours is so much larger,
dear," begged Janet.</p>

<p>"I be ca'eful!" Trouble promised. "I
find this big box for my s'ip in kitchen, an'
Sky drag it here for me!"</p>

<p>"Yes, Skyrocket is a good dog," said Ted.
"Hi there! Don't wag your tail so near my
ship, or you'll upset her before I beat Jan
in the race!" shouted Teddy, as the dog, in
his joy at being with the Curlytops, nearly
spoiled their plans for having fun.</p>

<p>"Here! Go chase that!" cried Ted, tossing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
a stick far down the brook. And as Skyrocket
splashed into the water after it, a
loud whistle was heard across the field on
the other side of the brook.</p>

<p>"There's the postman!" called Janet.</p>

<p>"Yes, he's coming here, and he's got a
letter in his hand," announced Teddy.
"He's taking the short cut."</p>

<p>Sometimes the mail carrier came across
the lots near the Martin home, as he was doing
on this occasion. The Curlytops ceased
the loading of their ships long enough to run
and meet the carrier.</p>

<p>"There's a letter for your mother," the
postman said, as he handed the missive to
Ted. "Don't drop it in the brook."</p>

<p>"I won't," promised the boy. "I wonder
who the letter is from?" he went on, as the
postman continued over the lots to his next
stopping place, blowing his whistle on the
way.</p>

<p>"Any mail, children?" called a voice.</p>

<p>"There's mother, now!" said Janet.</p>

<p>"Yes, here's a letter," called Ted. His
mother had walked down to the brook from
the house, along the back path, to see what
her Curlytops and Trouble were doing.</p>

<p>Mrs. Martin opened and read the letter<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
as Ted and Janet went back to their play,
and as she turned the pages she gave an exclamation
of wonder.</p>

<p>"What is it?" asked Ted, looking up as
he placed the last pebble on his ship.</p>

<p>"This is a letter from your Uncle Toby,"
said Mrs. Martin, "and there is strange
news in it. I wonder what it means? This
is very queer!"</p>

<p>She started to read the letter again, but
at that moment Janet cried:</p>

<p>"Oh, look at Trouble! Just look at him!
He's sailing away down the brook! Oh, he'll
be drowned!"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span></p>
<h5>AN AUTOMOBILE RIDE</h5>


<p>Mrs. Martin dropped the letter from
Uncle Toby. It fluttered to the ground as
she hastened down the bank of the brook in
which Trouble was sailing away, aboard the
small box he had brought to play with as
his "s'ip."</p>

<p>"William! William Anthony Martin!
Come right back here!" called Mrs. Martin.
"Come back!"</p>

<p>Poor William would have been glad
enough to do this, but he could not. He had
stepped into the box, shoved it out from
shore with a pole as he had seen Janet poling
her tiny ship along, and then the current
of the stream had carried poor Trouble away.
He was floating down the brook, which was
quite deep in some places.</p>

<p>"Oh, Trouble! Trouble! What shall I
do?" cried his mother.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span></p>

<p>"I'll run up to the house and get the
rake, and we can hook it on the edge of his
box and pull him out!" shouted Janet.</p>

<p>"I'll get him myself!" called Ted, and,
not thinking that he had on his shoes and
stockings, into the water he dashed, following
after the floating box in which Trouble
was riding. As for the little fellow himself,
he had been overjoyed, at first, when he
found that he was afloat. But as the water
came leaking through the cracks in the box
Trouble became frightened.</p>

<p>"Oh, Momsie! Come an' det me! Come
an' det me!" he wailed.</p>

<p>"Mother's coming!" called Mrs. Martin,
as she caught up a long stick and, running
along the edge of the brook, tried to reach
out and hook it over the side of the box-ship
in which William was sailing away.</p>

<p>And while the mother, brother and sister
of the little chap are going to his rescue, I
will take just a moment or two and tell you
something about the Martin children, and
why they are called the "Curlytops."</p>

<p>The reason for the odd, pretty name is not
hard to find. It was in their hair&mdash;they had
the cutest, curliest curly hair that ever grew
on the heads of any children anywhere in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
the world. So it is no wonder they were
called "Curlytops."</p>

<p>Some of you were introduced to them in
the first book of this series, "The Curlytops
at Cherry Farm," which told of their adventures
in the country.</p>

<p>After that they had more adventures on
"Star Island," where they went camping
with Grandpa. The fun on the island was
wonderful, even more wonderful were
their adventures when they were "Snowed
In" and when the Curlytops went to Uncle
Frank's ranch, and rode on ponyback. Ted,
Janet and Trouble thought they had never
seen such good times in all their lives. They
helped solve a strange mystery, too.</p>

<p>The book just before this one that you are
reading is named "The Curlytops at Silver
Lake," and in that you may learn what
Ted, Janet and Trouble did when they went
on the water with Uncle Ben, and how they
helped capture some bad men.</p>

<p>The summer had been filled with adventures,
and there were some good times in the
winter that followed. Now it was summer
again, and the Curlytops were ready for
more fun.</p>

<p>Mr. Richard Martin was the father of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
Curlytops. He was a storekeeper in the city
of Cresco, in one of our eastern states. There
were just three of the Curlytops, Theodore
Baradale, Janet and William Anthony Martin.
But Theodore was nearly always called
Ted or Teddy, Janet's name was shortened
to Jan and William answered to the call of
Trouble as often as to any other.</p>

<p>In addition to the children there was Skyrocket,
the dog, and Turnover, the cat. The
cat was called that name because she had a
trick of lying down and rolling over when
she wanted something to eat. There had
also been Nicknack, a goat, and Clipclap, a
pony, but these had been sent away for a
time, and the dog and cat were the only pets
the children had at present. But they were
soon going to have more, as I will tell you
presently.</p>

<p>It was a warm, pleasant, sunny day when
Ted and Jan went down to the brook to play
that pieces of boards were their "ships."
Then Trouble had joined them, and, just
after the mail carrier left the strange letter
from Uncle Toby, Trouble had, as usual, gotten
into trouble.</p>

<p>Janet and Teddy were not quite certain
who Uncle Toby might be. They had heard<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
of him, once or twice, as a distant relative of
their father or their mother, but they had
not seen him in a number of years. They
only dimly remembered him as an old man
who lived in a city about fifty miles from
Cresco, but they had not visited him in some
time.</p>

<p>Just now the plight of Trouble so filled
the minds of Ted and Jan that they had no
thought for Uncle Toby or his strange letter.
Nor did Mrs. Martin give any heed to the
missive she had dropped.</p>

<p>"Be careful, Teddy!" she called, as she
saw her older son splashing his way through
the water. "Don't fall!"</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I won't, Mother! Not if&mdash;if I&mdash;I can
help&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>But just as Teddy got that far he stumbled
on a round stone in the brook, and down he
went with a splash!</p>

<p>"Oh, he'll be drowned!" screamed Janet,
who was following her mother along the bank
of the brook, while Trouble was out in the
middle in his leaking, packing-box ship that
Skyrocket had pulled to the stream for him.
The dog, who had found the stick which
Teddy threw, had rushed back, and was now
barking as loudly as he could.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span></p>

<p>But the water was not deep enough to
drown Teddy. It, however, made him very
wet. Up he rose, dripping all over, and
gasping for breath.</p>

<p>Mrs. Martin paused only long enough to
look back and see that Teddy was all right,
and then hurried along, trying to pull toward
her, with the long stick, the floating
box and her little son.</p>

<p>"Det me out! Det me out! I is all wet&mdash;I
is!" cried Trouble. "My hoots is all wet!"
Sometimes the letter "f" bothered him, and
he put an "h" in its place, as saying "hoots"
for "foots." Of course neither word was
right, but who minded a thing like that when
poor Trouble was in such a plight?</p>

<p>"I'll get him!" cried Teddy, as he caught
his breath. Then he wiped some of the water
from his face, and dashed on down the brook.
But by this time the packing box, in which
Trouble was taking more of a ride than he
had counted on, was some distance down the
brook. However, Mrs. Martin was keeping
alongside of it, though it was beyond even the
reach of her long stick.</p>

<p>"If we were on the other side you could
reach him and pull him to shore, Mother!"
called Janet.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, I must get over on the other side&mdash;but
the brook is deep here!" said Mrs. Martin.
She was going to forget that, however,
and splash in, when the box, by some twist
of the current, suddenly floated near the
bank along which she was running.</p>

<p>"Grab it&mdash;quick!" cried Janet.</p>

<p>"Let me get it&mdash;I'm coming!" shouted
Teddy, and, indeed, he was splashing his
way down the brook, but some distance behind
his little brother.</p>

<p>"Oh, det me out! My hoots is awful wet!"
wailed the small chap in the packing-box
boat.</p>

<p>And just then Mrs. Martin was able to
reach out her stick, hook one end of it over
the edge of the box and pull it to shore.</p>

<p>"You poor little fellow! Was mother's
Trouble frightened to pieces?" murmured
Mrs. Martin as she lifted her youngest out
of the box, and, never minding his wet feet,
hugged him tightly. The packing box
drifted off downstream, Skyrocket racing
after it and barking as though it was the
best joke in the world. "Were you frightened,
William?" murmured his mother.</p>

<p>Trouble looked at her, and then at the
floating box.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span></p>

<p>"I had a nice wide, but my hoots is all
wet," he announced.</p>

<p>"I should say they were!" laughed Janet,
feeling them. "They're soaking wet! But
you're all right now, Trouble!"</p>

<p>"And I'm wet, too," said Teddy, coming
along just then.</p>

<p>Together they walked back along the edge
of the brook, Skyrocket following when he
found that no one was going to help him
play with the empty box, which floated
ashore near the dam Teddy had made.</p>

<p>As she passed the place where she had
dropped Uncle Toby's letter Mrs. Martin
picked up the fluttering paper.</p>

<p>"I nearly forgot all about this," she said.
"Your father will want to know about it.
I never heard anything so strange in all my
life."</p>

<p>"What is it?" asked Teddy.</p>

<p>"I'll tell you when you have dry clothes
on, and we can sit down and talk it over,"
his mother promised.</p>

<p>And when Trouble, smiling and happy,
with a picture book in his hands and dry
shoes and stockings on his feet, was safe in a
chair, and when Janet and Teddy sat near
her, Mrs. Martin read the letter again.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span></p>

<p>"It is from Uncle Toby Bardeen of Pocono,"
said the mother of the Curlytops.
"At least he is your father's uncle, but that
doesn't matter. He is an old bachelor, and
lives with a distant relative, a Mrs. Watson,
in an old, rambling house."</p>

<p>"Does he want us to come there for the
summer vacation?" asked Janet. It was
time, so she and Ted thought to begin thinking
of the summer fun.</p>

<p>"No, Uncle Toby doesn't say that," went
on Mother Martin, as she glanced over the
pages of the letter. "What he wants is for
your father to go and take charge of everything
that is in the old house&mdash;everything,
that is, except the housekeeper, Mrs. Watson.
She is going off by herself, Uncle Toby
says."</p>

<p>"Is Uncle Toby&mdash;is he&mdash;dead, that he
wants daddy to take everything in his
house?" asked Janet.</p>

<p>"Course not! How could he be dead and
write this letter?" asked Ted.</p>

<p>"Well, maybe he wrote it before he died,"
Janet suggested.</p>

<p>"No, Uncle Toby isn't dead, I'm glad to
say," remarked Mrs. Martin. "But he is
going away on a long voyage for his health,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
he writes, and he wants daddy to come and
take charge of everything in the old mansion."</p>

<p>"Do you s'pose there's a gun there I could
have?" asked Teddy hopefully.</p>

<p>"I'd like an old-fashioned spinning
wheel," said Janet. "Is there one of those,
Mother?"</p>

<p>"I wants suffin' to eat!" announced
Trouble suddenly, but whether he thought
it was to be had at Uncle Toby's house or
not, it is hard to say.</p>

<p>Teddy and Janet laughed, and Trouble
looked at them with wondering eyes.</p>

<p>"You shall have something to eat, love!"
his mother murmured. "I guess your voyage
in the packing-box ship made you hungry."</p>

<p>"Do you s'pose Uncle Toby would have
a gun?" asked Ted again.</p>

<p>"If there is one in his house <i>you</i> can't
have it, my dear," objected Mrs. Martin.</p>

<p>"But I could have the spinning wheel,
couldn't I?" asked Janet.</p>

<p>"Yes, I suppose so. But maybe there
isn't one," her mother answered.</p>

<p>"If there is we can play steamboat!" cried
Ted, getting quickly over his disappointment<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
about a possible gun. "A spinning
wheel is just the thing to steer a make-believe
steamer with!"</p>

<p>"You're not going to have my spinning
wheel for your old steamboat!" declared
Janet.</p>

<p>"Hush, children!" their mother warned
them. "I haven't the least idea what is in
Uncle Toby's house, that he should be so
mysterious about it, and be in such a hurry
for your father to come and take charge."</p>

<p>"Is Uncle Toby mysterious?" asked
Janet.</p>

<p>"Well, yes. He says he hopes the collection
will not be too much for us to manage,"
went on Mrs. Martin, with another look at
the letter.</p>

<p>"A collection of what?" Ted wanted to
know.</p>

<p>"That's just it&mdash;Uncle Toby doesn't say,"
his mother replied. "We shall have to wait
until your father makes the trip to Pocono."</p>

<p>"Oh, may we go?" begged the two Curlytops
at once.</p>

<p>"We'll see!" was the way in which Mrs.
Martin put them off. "I wish your father
were here so we could talk over this queer
letter from Uncle Toby."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span></p>

<p>"I wis'&mdash;I wis' I had suffin' t' <i>eat</i>!" put
in Trouble wistfully.</p>

<p>"And so you shall have, darling!" exclaimed
his mother. "It is nearly time for
lunch, and daddy will soon be here. Then
we'll see what he says."</p>

<p>And what Mr. Martin said after, at the
lunch table, he had read Uncle Toby's letter
was:</p>

<p>"Hum!"</p>

<p>"What do you think of it?" asked his
wife.</p>

<p>"I think it's as queer as he is," said the
father of the Curlytops, smiling. "Uncle
Toby is a dear old man, but very queer. So
he wants me to come and take charge of his
'collection,' does he? It's strange that he
doesn't say what his collection is."</p>

<p>"Maybe it's postage stamps," suggested
Ted. Once he had started to make a collection
like that but he had given it up.</p>

<p>"And maybe it's a collection of&mdash;money!"
said Janet.</p>

<p>"That would be very fine!" laughed her
father. "But though Uncle Toby is well off,
I hardly think he has a collection of money
lying around his old mansion. However, I
suppose I must go and see what it is the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
queer fellow wants me to take charge of for
him."</p>

<p>"May we go?" chorused Ted and Janet
again.</p>

<p>"Oh, I suppose so," agreed their father,
and this was better than the "I'll see," of
their mother.</p>

<p>"Me tum too!" declared Trouble. He
never wanted to be left behind.</p>

<p>"We'll all take an auto trip over to Pocono
to-morrow and see what Uncle Toby
has," decided Mr. Martin.</p>

<p>Accordingly, the next day, Mr. Martin
left his manager in charge of the store, and,
in the comfortable family automobile, the
Curlytops and their father, mother and
Trouble&mdash;not forgetting Skyrocket, the dog&mdash;started
off.</p>

<p>It was just as fine a day as the previous
one, when Trouble had sailed down the
brook. The grass was green, the birds sang,
and the wind blew gently in the trees.</p>

<p>"Oh, it's summer, and there's no school
and well have lots of fun!" sang Janet.</p>

<p>"Maybe we'll have fun with what we find
at Uncle Toby's house," suggested Ted.</p>

<p>And neither of the Curlytops realized how<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
much fun nor what strange adventures were
in store for them.</p>

<p>The automobile started down a rather
steep hill, and Mrs. Martin, who was on the
front seat with her husband, looked back to
see that the three children were safe.</p>

<p>"Hold on to Trouble!" she told Janet.
"He might bounce out. The road is very
rough!"</p>

<p>"Yes, it isn't very safe, either," murmured
Mr. Martin. "I hope nothing happens."</p>

<p>Hardly had he spoken than there was a
loud bang close behind him. He jammed on
the brakes and cried:</p>

<p>"Tire's burst! Hold tight&mdash;everybody!"</p>

<p>Then the automobile slid over to one side
of the road and Janet cried:</p>

<p>"Oh, Trouble! Trouble!"</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span></p>
<h5>THE QUEER OLD LADY</h5>

<p>For a little while it seemed as though
something serious had happened in the automobile
which was taking the Curlytops to
Uncle Toby's house. Mr. Martin had all he
could do to slow up the machine, bringing
it to a stop beside the road, and under a tree.
If a tire had burst or been punctured Daddy
Martin wanted to be in the shade to fix it.</p>

<p>Mother Martin, holding tightly to the side
of the seat when the banging noise sounded,
turned to look behind her to see if the three
children were all right. She saw Trouble
sitting between Ted and Janet, and William
was looking at something in his chubby
hand.</p>

<p>"What happened?" asked Mrs. Martin.
"Were any of you hurt when the tire burst?"</p>

<p>"The tire didn't burst, Mother," answered
Teddy.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span></p>

<p>"Why, I heard it," said Mr. Martin, as
he prepared to get out of the machine, which
had now come to a stop. "I must have run
over a sharp stone or a broken bottle."</p>

<p>"No, it wasn't the tire," said Janet, and
she laughed. "It was Trouble's toy balloon.
He blew it up too big and it burst."</p>

<p>"That's what it was! And a piece of the
rubber hit me in the eye!" laughed Ted.</p>

<p>"My 'loon all gone!" wailed William.</p>

<p>"So that's what it was&mdash;a burst toy balloon,"
said Daddy Martin. "Well, I'm glad
it wasn't one of my tires."</p>

<p>"So am I," said Mother Martin. "It is
too hot to have to change a tire to-day. Besides,
I'm in a hurry to get to Uncle Toby's
and see what it is he wants us to take charge
of while he is away. I hope he doesn't go
until we get there."</p>

<p>"You never can tell what Uncle Toby is
going to do," said Mr. Martin, smiling, now
that he knew he had no tire to change. "And
so you burst your toy balloon, did you,
Trouble? Well, I'll have to get you another,
but not while we're on this auto ride. I
don't want to be frightened again, and I
might be if you blew up another balloon and
it burst."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span></p>

<p>"I didn't know he had one with him," remarked
Mrs. Martin, as Trouble looked sadly
at what was left of his toy.</p>

<p>"I didn't either," Janet said. "All of a
sudden he took it out of his pocket and began
to blow it up."</p>

<p>"I was makin' be'eve it were a wed soap
bubbles," explained Trouble.</p>

<p>"Well, soap bubbles or not, it burst," said
Teddy. "It sure did make a noise! But now
we can go on. I want to see if Uncle Toby
is going to leave any guns."</p>

<p>"And I want a spinning wheel," Janet
murmured. "But you can't take it to play
steamboat with," she told her brother.</p>

<p>"I shan't want it if I have a gun!" retorted
Ted.</p>

<p>"Now, children, be nice," begged their
mother.</p>

<p>Daddy Martin started the automobile
again, first getting out to look at the four
tires, to make sure none was flat, punctured
or burst. They were all round, plump and
as fat as big bologna sausages.</p>

<p>"Now we go to Uncle Toby. Maybe I get
a kittie cat!" said Trouble, when he decided
to smile after feeling so bad about his burst
balloon.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span></p>

<p>"A kittie cat!" exclaimed Janet. "Why,
we have a lovely cat, Trouble. Don't you
like Turnover?"</p>

<p>"Yep! But I 'ikes a kittie cat, too. Maybe
Uncle Toby hab one for me!"</p>

<p>"Probably Uncle Toby is too old a man to
bother with pet cats," said Mrs. Martin.</p>

<p>But it only goes to show that you never
know what is going to happen in this world&mdash;sometimes
you don't even know what you
are going to have for dinner.</p>

<p>Along rolled the automobile, taking the
Curlytops nearer and nearer to the city of
Pocono, where Uncle Toby lived with his
housekeeper, Mrs. Watson. But it was
rather a long ride, and, about half way, the
party stopped in a little village for lunch.</p>

<p>"Did we bring any lunch with us, or are
we going in a place to eat?" asked Ted.</p>

<p>"Oh, I hope we go in a place to eat!" exclaimed
Janet. "I like a restaurant, don't
you, Ted?"</p>

<p>"Sure!" answered the Curlytop boy.</p>

<p>"Yes, we are going to a restaurant," his
mother told them. "Daddy wants to get
some oil and gasoline for the auto, too."</p>

<p>"It's sort of feeding the auto, isn't it,
Mother?" asked Janet, as they alighted.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span></p>

<p>"In a way, yes," admitted Mrs. Martin.</p>

<p>A little later the Curlytops were having
a fine meal, and when I say the Curlytops I
mean also Daddy and Mother Martin, and
Trouble. The hair of Mr. and Mrs. Martin
did not curl, though it must have done so
when they were younger; or else how would
Ted and Janet have had such beautiful ringlets?
Nor did Trouble's hair curl, though
when he was smaller his mother used to wind
little ringlets around her finger, hoping he
would have locks as pretty as those of Janet
and Ted. But, really, the older boy and girl
were the only ones who could, truly, be called
Curlytops, though I sometimes speak of the
"Curlytop family."</p>

<p>So you know, when I say that the "Curlytops"
were eating lunch, that all five of them
were enjoying their meal. There were several
things that Janet, Teddy and Trouble
liked to eat, and toward the end of the meal
there was a piece of pie for each of them.
And it was toward the end of the meal that
something happened, and Trouble, as usual,
was the cause of it.</p>

<p>Just before the waiter had brought the pie
there had sounded, out in the street, the
music of a hand organ. No sooner had he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
heard this than Trouble slipped from his
chair (where he had been sitting on a hassock
to make him higher) and ran to the window.</p>

<p>"No monkey!" called out the little fellow,
after he had stood for a moment with his
nose pressed against the pane of glass, making
his "smeller," as he sometimes called it,
quite flat. "Hand-organ grinder got no
monkey!"</p>

<p>Trouble was disappointed. He had hoped
to see a little monkey scrambling around to
gather pennies in his cap. But this hand-organ
player did not have any. And there
was nothing much for Trouble to see. So
the little fellow came back to the table, but
not before he had stopped at the big water-cooler
in one corner of the dining room.
Trouble paused to watch a waiter turn the
shiny little faucet and draw a glass of water
for a customer.</p>

<p>"Come and get your pie, William," his
mother called to him. She very seldom mentioned
him as "Trouble," before strangers.
So this time Mrs. Martin called her little boy
by his right name.</p>

<p>"Do you want me to eat your pie?" teased
Ted.</p>

<p>"No! I eat my own pie!" Trouble exclaimed,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
and he climbed up into his chair,
being helped by his father, next to whom he
sat.</p>

<p>The meal was almost over, and Daddy
Martin was wondering what his Uncle Toby
could want him to take charge of, when Mrs.
Martin gave a sudden start, a sort of shiver,
and said:</p>

<p>"Why, my feet are getting wet!"</p>

<p>"Your feet wet!" exclaimed her husband.
"Surely it isn't raining in here! It isn't
even raining outside!" he laughed, as he
looked from a window.</p>

<p>"But my feet are damp," went on Mrs.
Martin. Then she raised the cloth, which
hung down rather low on each side of the
table, and glanced at the floor. "There's
a big puddle of water under our table!" she
cried.</p>

<p>Then Ted looked over toward the big
water-cooler in one corner of the restaurant.</p>

<p>"Somebody left the faucet open!" cried
Teddy. "The ice water is all running out!
No wonder your feet are wet, Mother!"</p>

<p>Mr. Martin hastily left his chair and
turned off the faucet, and, as he did so, he
looked at Trouble. Something in the face<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
of that youngster caused Daddy Martin to
ask:</p>

<p>"William, did you do that?"</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I dess maybe I turned it on a 'ittle
bit!" confessed the mischievous one.</p>

<p>"A <i>little</i> bit!" cried Janet, as she looked
under the table. "Why, there's almost as
much water as there is in our brook at
home!"</p>

<p>"Oh, not quite so much," said her mother
gently. "Though there is enough to have
wet through the soles of my shoes. I was
wondering why my feet felt so damp and
cold. And did Trouble turn on the water?
Oh, Trouble!"</p>

<p>All eyes gazed at the little fellow, and he
seemed to think he should explain what he
had done.</p>

<p>"I 'ist turned de handle a teeny bit," he
said, "to make a 'ittle water come out. An'
den I fordot 'bout it!"</p>

<p>That was just what he had done. Seeing
the waiter draw a glass of water from the
cooler had given Trouble the idea that he
soon afterward carried out. When he saw
no monkey with the hand organ, the little
fellow had gone back to his seat and, on the
way, opened the faucet so that the water ran<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
out in a little stream. Soon the drip-pan
was full and then the water began trickling
over the floor. No one noticed it until it had
made a little puddle under the table, just at
the point where Mrs. Martin's feet were.</p>

<p>"Oh, Trouble! what will you do next?"
sighed the little fellow's mother.</p>

<p>"No harm done at all! None whatever!"
said the waiter, coming up to the table smiling.
"That little water on the floor I will
wipe up so quick you will never see it."</p>

<p>"No, it won't hurt the floor much," Mr.
Martin said. "And I suppose your shoes
will dry out," he told his wife. "But, all the
same, William should not have done it."</p>

<p>"I won't do it any more," said the little
fellow. "I be good now! I sorry!"</p>

<p>He generally was when he had done something
like that. However, as the waiter had
said, little real harm was done, and Mrs.
Martin's shoes would dry, for it was a hot,
summer day.</p>

<p>The meal was finished and they all took
their places in the automobile again to finish
the ride to Uncle Toby's place, about twenty
miles farther on.</p>

<p>Once again Trouble, Ted and Janet sat in
the rear seat, while their father and mother<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
rode in front. And this time Trouble had no
red balloon which he could blow up, making
it burst with a noise like a punctured tire.
The children talked among themselves, wondering
over and over again what it could be
that Uncle Toby wanted their father to come
and take charge of.</p>

<p>"Maybe he's got a little boy or a girl from
an orphan asylum, and he wants us to take it
to live with us," suggested Janet.</p>

<p>"A boy would be all right," decided Ted,
as he thought of this. "I could have fun
with another fellow."</p>

<p>"And I'd like a girl," said Janet. "I always
wished I had a sister."</p>

<p>"Maybe they're twins&mdash;a boy and a girl,"
Ted went on. "That would be fun!"</p>

<p>"What would be fun?" asked his mother
from the front seat, where she had heard the
talk of the children. She often asked a question
like this, as it sometimes stopped a bit
of mischief that, otherwise, might happen.
"What fun are you talking about?" asked
Mrs. Martin.</p>

<p>"Uncle Toby," answered Janet. "I
thought maybe what he wanted daddy to take
charge of was a little orphan girl."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span></p>

<p>"And I thought maybe it was a boy,"
added Ted.</p>

<p>"And then we both thought maybe it was
twins&mdash;a boy and a girl, and we'd each have
someone to play with," went on Janet.</p>

<p>"My! I don't believe Uncle Toby has
adopted any orphan children that he wants
us to take," Mrs. Martin said. "I can't imagine
what he really has, but we'll soon find
out."</p>

<p>On and on they rode in the automobile,
until, after a while, they reached the small
city of Pocono and, a little later, they pulled
up in front of Uncle Toby's house. It was a
rambling, old mansion that once had looked
very nice, but now it was rather shabby and
needed painting.</p>

<p>"Here is where Uncle Toby lives," said
Daddy Martin. "Do you children remember
it?"</p>

<p>"A little," admitted Ted. Neither he nor
Janet had been there in years, and Trouble
had never visited Uncle Toby.</p>

<p>"I wonder if he's at home," went on
Daddy Martin, as he alighted from the automobile.</p>

<p>"There's someone on the porch," said
Mrs. Martin. "Oh, it's Mrs. Watson, the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
housekeeper," she added. "But something
seems to be the matter! I wonder what can
have happened?"</p>

<p>As Mother Martin spoke a queer little
old lady came down off the porch and along
the walk, hurrying out to meet the Curlytops,
all of whom were now at the front gate.</p>

<p>"Wait! Don't go in! Don't go in!" cried
the queer old lady, holding up her hand like
a traffic policeman stopping a fast automobile.
"Don't go in! They're having a terrible
time! Oh, that Mr. Bardeen ever
should have gone away and left me to look
after 'em! Oh, the trouble I have had!
Such trouble! Don't go in! Listen to 'em!"</p>

<p>As she spoke there came strange sounds
from the grim old house where Uncle Toby
lived! Very strange sounds!</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span></p>
<h5>UNCLE TOBY'S PETS</h5>

<p>"Listen to that noise!" called Teddy,
pausing with his hand on the gate that led
into Uncle Toby's yard. "It's two boys having
fun. I guess Uncle Toby left two fellows
that you can take home and I can have
fun with," Teddy added laughingly to his
father.</p>

<p>"Two boys! Oh, my goodness!" exclaimed
Mrs. Martin.</p>

<p>Just then a shrill scream sounded from
within the queer, old house.</p>

<p>"It's girls!" said Janet. "Girls cry just
like that when they're having fun! Oh, I'll
be glad to have a sister to play with!"</p>

<p>Mr. and Mrs. Martin looked at each other
in surprise and wonderment. What could
it mean? The queer, little old lady&mdash;Mrs.
Watson, the housekeeper&mdash;murmured again:</p>

<p>"Listen to 'em! I can't do a thing with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
'em since Uncle Toby went away. I'm so
glad you came to take charge of 'em as he
asked you to. You did come for that, didn't
you?" she asked eagerly. "You got Uncle
Toby's letter, asking you to come and take
charge of the collection he left, didn't you?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes," answered the father of the
Curlytops. "We got Uncle Toby's letter all
right, and we came to take charge. But&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"We'd like to know <i>what</i> we are going to
take!" interrupted Mrs. Martin. She felt
she must say something, with all those queer
noises going on in the house.</p>

<p>"Maybe it's babies!" suggested Trouble,
as he listened to what seemed to be a crying
sound from the old mansion.</p>

<p>"They're worse than babies!" declared
Mrs. Watson. "I don't mind children and
babies. But these things make so much noise
I can't hear myself think. That's why I
came out on the steps to sit down and be
quiet! Oh, I'm so glad you've come to take
charge of 'em!"</p>

<p>"But what are they? You haven't told
us what they are," said Mr. Martin, as the
screeching, yelling noises kept on sounding<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
from within the house. "Do they always
screech like that?"</p>

<p>"Only when they're hungry," said the
queer old lady. "And I expect they're hungry
now. I just hate to go in to feed them,
they make such a fuss, and I'm afraid some
of 'em  will bite me. Not on purpose you
know," she quickly added, "but just because
they're so playful and full of fun."</p>

<p>"My dear Mrs. Watson," said Mr. Martin
in slow tones, "will you <i>please</i> tell us what
it is my Uncle Toby has left for me to take
charge of! Is it an insane asylum?"</p>

<p>"Yes, for goodness' sake, please tell us!"
begged the mother of the Curlytops.</p>

<p>"Why, I thought you knew!" replied Mrs.
Watson, in some surprise. "Didn't Uncle
Toby speak of them in his letter?"</p>

<p>"No, he did not say what they were," answered
Mr. Martin. "He only mentioned a
collection. Please tell us. What is making
all that racket?"</p>

<p>"Uncle Toby's pets," was the answer.
"Uncle Toby said he was going to leave
them to you when he went away on a long
trip. He may be gone for several years, and
he said he might live the rest of his life in
South America, where he is going. So he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
told me to give you his pets to take charge
of. You are to take them, and do as you
please with them, though I guess Uncle Toby
would like to have you keep them and be
kind to them."</p>

<p>"Uncle Toby's <i>pets</i>!" exclaimed Mrs.
Martin.</p>

<p>"Is there a dog?" asked Teddy, his eyes
shining in delight. "Won't Skyrocket be
glad? Do you hear that, old fellow?" went
on Teddy, leaning down to pet the dog that
had jumped from the automobile and was
looking as if in wonder at the house whence
came such strange noises. "You're going to
have another dog to play with. Uncle Toby
did leave a dog, didn't he?" Teddy asked of
Mrs. Watson. "I hear a dog barking in the
house."</p>

<p>"A dog!" exclaimed the queer little old
housekeeper. "He left <i>two</i> dogs, Uncle
Toby did!"</p>

<p>"Two dogs!" murmured Mrs. Martin,
with a hopeless look at her husband.</p>

<p>"Did he leave a cat?" asked Janet. "I
thought I heard one mewing. And Turnover
would like another cat to play with."</p>

<p>"Yes, Uncle Toby left you a cat, also,"
said Mrs. Watson.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span></p>

<p>Just then shrill screams, barks, squeaks
and squawks, all mixed together, seemed to
float out of the opened windows of the old
house&mdash;windows in which were strong wire
screens.</p>

<p>"Two dogs and a cat!" exclaimed Mr.
Martin. "My dear Mrs. Watson," he went
on, as he sat down on the top step of the
porch rather limply, "will you please tell
us, as fast as you can, just how many and
what pets Uncle Toby has left us? We may
as well hear the worst at once," he said to
his wife. "I never imagined Uncle Toby
cared for animal pets."</p>

<p>"Oh, indeed he did," replied Mrs. Watson.
"Of late years he grew very fond of
animals. All his pets are animals, and he'd
have gotten more only I said I wouldn't stay
and keep house for him if he brought in
what he spoke of last."</p>

<p>"What was that?" Mrs. Martin wanted
to know.</p>

<p>"<i>Snakes</i>!" declared the little old lady.
"I don't mind monkeys and parrots so
much, but I can't bear <i>snakes</i>! They give
me the shivers, though Uncle Toby said some
snakes do a lot of good in this world, by<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
catching rats and mice. But he didn't bring
in any snakes!"</p>

<p>"Do you mean to say he has a parrot?"
asked Mr. Martin.</p>

<p>"Don't you hear him?" questioned Mrs.
Watson. "Listen!"</p>

<p>As she finished speaking the Curlytops
heard a shrill:</p>

<p>"Cracker! Cracker! Give Polly a crack-crack-cracker!"</p>

<p>"Oh, it <i>is</i> a parrot!" cried Janet in delight.</p>

<p>"And is there a monkey, too?" demanded
Ted.</p>

<p>"An' a han' ordan! Is dere a han' ordan?"
asked Trouble.</p>

<p>"No hand organ, child, no," answered
Mrs. Watson. "But there is a monkey, a
parrot, two dogs, and a cat, a&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Stop! Wait a moment!" begged Mrs.
Martin. She took a seat beside her husband
on the top step. "I just wanted to sit down
before I fainted when I heard the worst,"
she went on. "Now go ahead, Mrs. Watson.
Tell me the rest. I'll have something to lean
against in case she tells me there's an elephant."</p>

<p>"An elephant!" cried Janet.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, I don't mean I want to lean on the
elephant," said her mother. "I just want to
lean against the piazza post. This is the
worst I ever heard of&mdash;Uncle Toby leaving
us a menagerie!"</p>

<p>"'Tisn't quite as bad as that, though 'tis,
almost," said Mrs. Watson. "There isn't an
elephant, but there is an alligator."</p>

<p>"An alligator! Oh, that's great!" cried
Ted. "Where is it?"</p>

<p>"This is terrible!" declared his mother.</p>

<p>"It's only a little alligator," explained the
housekeeper. "He's real friendly, though
his tail scratches when he rubs it against
your hand as you feed him."</p>

<p>"Anything else?" asked Mr. Martin.
"Please go on. We may as well hear the
worst. It sounds like a circus that Uncle
Toby kept in his house. What else, Mrs.
Watson?"</p>

<p>"Well? that's about all, except some white
rats and mice and the pigeons. Uncle Toby
didn't get the snake he wanted."</p>

<p>"Let us be thankful for that," murmured
Mrs. Martin, "though it is bad enough as
it is."</p>

<p>"Bad?" cried Teddy. "I think it's jolly!<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
Can't we go in and see Uncle Toby's pets?"
he asked.</p>

<p>"They're going to be our pets, aren't
they, Daddy?" asked Jan. "Didn't Uncle
Toby say you could have them?"</p>

<p>"That's what he said," replied the father
of the Curlytops. "But I don't know
whether to take him at his word or not. But
we may as well go in and look at the&mdash;the
menagerie!" he said to his wife, with a smile.</p>

<p>"They'll need feeding&mdash;the animals will,"
said Mrs. Watson. "I'm glad you're here
to help me. I was staying only until you
came. Uncle Toby said you'd be over in a
day or two. I'm leaving to-night, now
you're here."</p>

<p>"What? And make us take care of all
the pets?" cried Mrs. Martin.</p>

<p>"Oh, they're real kind and gentle&mdash;every
one, even the little alligator," Uncle Toby's
housekeeper made haste to say. "And as
long as you have children the pets will be
just the things for the Curlytops. Only I
can't stay much longer. I was just waiting
for you. I went outside as it was quieter,"
she concluded, as, once again, the pet animals
set up a screeching, barking and mewing.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well, let's get it over with," suggested
Mr. Martin. "Maybe they'll be quieter if
we feed them. Is there anything in the house
for the menagerie to eat?" he asked the little
old housekeeper.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, Uncle Toby always fed them
well," she answered. "Oh, I'm so glad you
came to take charge of the pets!"</p>

<p>"I don't know whether we are or not,"
remarked Mrs. Martin. "I suppose,
though," she said to her husband in a low
voice, as they prepared to enter the house,
"we can sell them. We don't have to keep
them."</p>

<p>"Yes, I guess that would be best&mdash;to sell
them," agreed Mr. Martin, but he did not
let the Curlytops hear him say this.</p>

<p>Led by Mrs. Watson, the Curlytop party
entered the house. As the door was opened
the different noises sounded more loudly
than before.</p>

<p>The dogs barked&mdash;and Ted could now hear
the tones of two different animals&mdash;the cat
mewed, the monkey screeched and chattered,
and the parrot cried:</p>

<p>"Give Polly a cracker! Polly wants a
crack-crack-cracker!"</p>

<p>"I guess the alligator is the only one that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
isn't saying anything," remarked Mr. Martin
to his wife as they entered. "And I
never heard that alligators make a noise."</p>

<p>"Yes they do!" said Janet, eagerly. "I
read it in my natural history book. They
make a noise like a grunt. At least it's either
alligators or crocodiles, I've forgotten which.
But one kind bellows like a bull."</p>

<p>"Goodness! Let us hope this one
doesn't!" sighed Mrs. Martin. "Who would
ever think that Uncle Toby would keep a
menagerie!" she murmured.</p>

<p>"I never did," agreed her husband.</p>

<p>"They're all in one big room&mdash;a sort of
addition to the house. It opens off the dining
room," explained Mrs. Watson. "Uncle
Toby liked to eat when his pets did, that's
why he had 'em so near him in the dining
room. I'll show 'em to you."</p>

<p>"Are the pigeons out there, too?" asked
Mrs. Martin.</p>

<p>"No, Uncle Toby kept them in the barn,"
the housekeeper replied. "If you don't
want the pigeons, Uncle Toby told me to tell
you there's a boy in this same street who
will take them. But Uncle Toby said he
wished you'd take charge of all the other
pets."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span></p>

</div>

<p>"Oh, yes, Mother&mdash;Daddy! Let's keep
'em <i>all</i>!" pleaded Janet.</p>

<p>By this time Mrs. Watson had opened the
door leading into the extra room that Uncle
Toby had built to house his pets. No sooner
was the door opened than the noise sounded
louder than ever, and several things happened.</p>

<p>"Oh, look at the lovely cat!" cried Janet,
as one with very fluffy fur walked forward
as though to meet the Curlytops. "It's a
Persian, I guess. Oh, I just love a Persian!
Turnover is very nice, but I love this one a
lot," and she reached down to stroke the
beautiful cat that seemed very friendly.</p>

<p>"Oh, look!" suddenly cried Ted. "See!
The dogs do tricks!"</p>

<p>As he spoke one white poodle came walking
along on his hind legs, with his front
paws held in a funny fashion before him.</p>

<p>"Bow wow!" barked the poodle. And
then, as if this might be a signal, there suddenly
came from the end of the room another
white poodle, so nearly like the first that it
was difficult to tell them apart.</p>

<p>"Oh, see! More tricks!" cried Ted.</p>

<p>The second dog began turning somersaults.
One after another he turned, making<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
his way, in this fashion, to where Ted was
patting the head of the poodle that was
standing on its hind legs.</p>

<p>"Say! I can have a regular circus with
these trick dogs!" cried Ted in delight.</p>

<p>"And my Persian cat can be in it," added
Janet.</p>

<p>Just then a cry, as if of fear, came from
Trouble. Turning around the Curlytops and
others saw a strange sight.</p>

<p>A brown monkey was hanging by its tail
from an electric chandelier in the middle of
the room, and, thus reaching down, was trying
to pull Trouble's cap from the little fellow's
head.</p>

<p>"'Top! 'Top it!" shouted William.
"Make han'-ordan monkey let my cap
alone!" he wailed. And then, with a flutter
and a screech, a green and red parrot flew
from its perch and landed on Mrs. Martin's
shoulder. The pets of the Curlytops were
having a lively time!</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span></p>
<h5>TIP AND TOP</h5>

<p>With the barking of the trick dogs, in
which Skyrocket joined, and with the mewing
of the Persian cat, the shrieking of the
parrot, and the chattering of the monkey,
for a time there was so much noise in Uncle
Toby's "menagerie," as it was called, that
the voices of Mr. and Mrs. Martin could
scarcely be heard. But you could hear the
voice of Trouble above everything.</p>

<p>"Take him off! Make him 'top!" cried the
little fellow. For by this time the monkey,
having hung down by his tail from the chandelier,
and having taken off Trouble's cap,
was now trying to pull the little boy's hair.</p>

<p>"Bad monkey! Make him go 'way!" cried
Trouble.</p>



<p>"And I don't like this parrot!" said Mrs.
Martin, though, to be sure, the bird was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
gentle enough. It only sat on her shoulder
and shrieked:</p>

<p>"Crack! Crack! Cracker! I'm a cracker-acker:"</p>

<p>"Say, this is great!" cried Ted, as he
watched the two dogs, one of which was
marching around on his hind legs while the
other was turning somersaults.</p>

<p>"Oh, it's terrible!" said Mrs. Martin.
"Dick," she called to her husband, "can't
you make that monkey stop hurting William?"</p>

<p>"He isn't exactly hurting him, my dear,"
replied Mr. Martin. "Though I fancy
Trouble is a bit frightened. I was going to
take that parrot off your shoulder."</p>

<p>"Well, look after William first. He needs
it more than I."</p>

<p>Mr. Martin advanced toward the monkey,
swinging by his tail from the chandelier,
when Mrs. Watson, the housekeeper, said:</p>

<p>"I'll attend to him! I know how to manage
Jack if I don't any of the other animals.
I found a way to make him behave. Here!"
she suddenly cried, catching up a feather-duster
and shaking it at the long-tailed
creature. "Get back to your cubby-hole,
Jack!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span></p>

<p>With a shrill chatter the monkey dropped
Trouble's cap, which he was trying to make
stick on his own head, and a moment later he
jumped down from the chandelier and
scampered into a box at the side of the room.</p>

<p>"That's where he belongs!" said Mrs.
Watson. "He's always afraid of that
feather-duster. Maybe he thinks it's a big
eagle coming to bite his tail. Anyhow, show
him the feather-duster whenever you want
to quiet him."</p>

<p>"That's a good thing to know," said Mr.
Martin, when it was a little quieter in the
room, because Jack, the monkey, had stopped
chattering. "But what shall we do about the
parrot on my wife's shoulder?"</p>

<p>"Oh, Mr. Nip is all right. He's very
gentle," said the housekeeper. "Uncle Toby
named him Mr. Nip because he used to nip
and bite when he first came. But Uncle
Toby soon cured him of that. Mr. Nip is a
nice polly."</p>

<p>"I'm a crack! I'm a crack! I'm a crack-crack-cracker!"
shrieked the parrot, and
then he flew from Mrs. Martin's shoulder to
the regular perch, near the little cage of the
monkey&mdash;the "cubby-hole," as Mrs. Watson
called it.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span></p>

<p>"Thank goodness!" sighed the mother of
the Curlytops.</p>

<p>"You scared, Mother?" asked Trouble,
who was now wishing the monkey would
come back, for after his first fright, the little
fellow rather liked the fuzzy chap.</p>

<p>"Only a little," said Mrs. Martin, for she
thought if the Curlytops were to have anything
to do with Uncle Toby's pets, it would
not be well for her to say they frightened
her.</p>

<p>"I 'ike 'em all," remarked Trouble, while
Janet was rubbing the big Persian cat and
Ted was playing with the two dogs. "Uncle
Toby nice man to have all nanimals 'ike
dis!" and he looked around the room. Surely
there were quite a number of animal pets
there.</p>

<p>"How in the world did my uncle ever come
to have so many?" asked Mr. Martin. "And
what in the world are we going to do with
them?"</p>

<p>"I'll tell you about it after we've fed
them," said Mrs. Watson. "They'll be
quieter after they're fed, and you might as
well start in now to give them something to
eat. If you're going to take 'em with you
and keep 'em you'll have to feed 'em."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span></p>

<p>With the help of Ted and Janet, who set
out food to the dogs and cat, Uncle Toby's
animals were soon all being given things to
eat, and this made them quiet.  Then, while
the children stood and watched the animals
eat, Mrs. Watson took Daddy and Mother
Martin into the next room and told them
about Uncle Toby and the pets.</p>

<p>"I never knew that my uncle was so fond
of animals," said Mr. Martin.</p>

<p>"He wasn't, when I first came here to keep
house for him," explained Mrs. Watson.
"But he made friends, once, with a sailor,
who had the parrot. When the sailor started
off on his next sea voyage, and didn't want
to take Mr. Nip, the parrot, with him, Uncle
Toby said the bird could stay here. I didn't
much mind that, as it was rather lonesome
when Uncle Toby&mdash;as I always call him&mdash;went
out. So I got to liking Mr. Nip."</p>

<p>"Then, after a while, another sailor gave
Uncle Toby Jack, the monkey. The house
was more lively after that, for the monkey
and parrot used to fight, though they don't
any more. I thought this would be about all
the pets Uncle Toby would get; but lo and
behold! about a month after that another
sailor, hearing that Uncle Toby had a monkey<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
and a parrot, came and asked us if we
wouldn't take Slider."</p>

<p>"Who is Slider?" asked Mrs. Martin. "It
sounds like a pair of roller skates."</p>

<p>"Slider is the pet alligator. He came from
Florida," explained Mrs. Watson. "Uncle
Toby took him in, as he had the monkey and
the parrot, and I began to wonder what
would happen next."</p>

<p>"Did anything?" asked Daddy Martin, as
he watched the Curlytops playing in the next
room with the pets.</p>

<p>"Oh, my land, yes!" exclaimed Mrs. Watson.
"It wasn't more than two weeks after
he got Slider&mdash;that's the alligator&mdash;that an
old circus man came along with the two dogs,
Tip and Top."</p>

<p>"Are those their names?" asked Mrs.
Martin, watching Ted as he made one of the
dogs turn somersaults.</p>

<p>"Yes, one of the white poodles&mdash;the one
with the black spot on his tail&mdash;is named
Tip," the housekeeper said. "You see the
spot is on the tip of his tail."</p>

<p>"I can see that&mdash;yes," replied Mr. Martin
from where he sat. He was wondering where
all this was going to end.</p>

<p>"And the other dog is named Top," said<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
the housekeeper. "He has a black spot on
the top of his head."</p>

<p>"They are both very nice, and I like the
names, too&mdash;Tip and Top," remarked Mrs.
Martin. "See!" she exclaimed. "Our own
dog, Skyrocket, is making friends with
them."</p>

<p>Indeed Skyrocket, the Curlytop's dog,
was doing this very thing. Perhaps he
wanted to learn how to walk on his hind legs
and turn somersaults, as Tip and Top could
do.</p>

<p>"Tip and Top are two valuable dogs,"
said Mrs. Watson. "They were once in the
circus, and it was there they learned to do
their tricks, though Uncle Toby taught them
others."</p>

<p>"Why didn't the circus man keep them if
they were so valuable?" asked Mrs. Martin.</p>

<p>"The circus man had made friends with
the sailor who gave Uncle Toby the alligator,"
explained the housekeeper, "and the
circus man decided to become a sailor, too.
He said he didn't want to keep the dogs on
a ship, so he gave them to Uncle Toby."</p>

<p>"And that's how the menagerie started?"
asked Daddy Martin.</p>

<p>"That's how it started," said Mrs. Watson.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
"There were times when I thought it
would never end. That was when a lady,
who was going to travel for her health, asked
Uncle Toby to keep Snuff, her Persian cat."</p>

<p>"Is Snuff the cat's name?" asked the
mother of the Curlytops.</p>

<p>"Yes," answered Mrs. Watson. "It is
just the color of snuff, you see, a sort of yellowish
brown. Many Persian cats have that
color, I'm told. Anyhow this lady&mdash;I've forgotten
her name&mdash;said she saw that Uncle
Toby loved animals, as he had so many of
them, so she asked him to keep her cat."</p>

<p>"And Uncle Toby did," remarked Mrs.
Martin.</p>

<p>"Uncle Toby surely did!" declared the
housekeeper. "It seemed he couldn't say
'no' where animals were concerned. By this
time the house began to be rather overrun
with pets, so he built this room out of the
dining room, with special cages&mdash;cubby-holes
I call 'em&mdash;for the pets. I did think
Snuff would be the last one, but after that
came the white mice and rats."</p>

<p>"It's usually the other way about," said
Mrs. Martin, with a smile. "When the cat
comes the mice go. But this time the mice
came after the cat arrived."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes," agreed the housekeeper. "Snuff,
the cat, and the white mice&mdash;I don't know
their names&mdash;are great friends. The mice
and rats belonged to a boy down the street.
His family moved to another state last summer,
and his folks made him get rid of the
mice. He brought them to Uncle Toby, and
of course Uncle Toby couldn't say no, so he
kept them. It was then I first threatened to
leave. The house was too full of animals."</p>

<p>"But you didn't go," said Mrs. Martin.</p>

<p>"No, I stayed on, because Uncle Toby
begged me to, and he said he wouldn't add to
his collection. But then came the pigeons.
They were brought by another boy, whose
folks moved away and he couldn't keep 'em
any more. I didn't so much mind the pigeons,
as they stay out in the barn. But we
certainly had a houseful of pets! After a
while I got rather to liking them, and Uncle
Toby was very fond of 'em, and taught 'em
many tricks."</p>

<p>"But finally, as you know from the letter
he wrote you, he decided to take a long trip,
and perhaps he may never come back, if he
finds he likes it in South America. So he
decided to ask you to take charge of his collection,
and I said I'd stay until you arrived,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
as Uncle Toby had to leave in a hurry, to
catch a ship that was sailing for South
America."</p>

<p>"Why did he go there?" asked Mr. Martin.</p>

<p>"I think it was because he heard that
monkeys and parrots come from there," the
housekeeper answered. "He seemed to like
those animals better than any others, though
Tip and Top, the two dogs, are more valuable,
because they can do circus tricks."</p>

<p>"They certainly are cute," said Mrs. Martin.</p>

<p>"Well, there you have the story of Uncle
Toby's pets," said Mrs. Watson, "though I
suppose they'll be the Curlytops' pets now,
for Uncle Toby said he was going to give
you his collection."</p>

<p>"Hum! Yes," mused Mr. Martin. "If I
had known what the collection was I don't
believe I would have come after it."</p>

<p>Mrs. Watson began putting on her hat,
and from a corner of the room she picked
up her valise, which she had already packed.</p>

<p>"Where are you going?" asked Mrs.
Martin.</p>

<p>"I am going away," answered the housekeeper.
"My plans are all made. I am<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
going to live with my sister. All she keeps
is a cat, and she puts that outside and winds
the clock every night before she goes to bed.
I'm going to her house. I told Uncle Toby
I'd stay until the Curlytops came to take
charge of the pets, and, now that you are
here, I'll be going."</p>

<p>"But I say! Look here! What are we
going to do?" asked Mr. Martin.</p>

<p>"Why, you're to take charge of the collection,"
said the housekeeper. "That's what
Uncle Toby said in his letter. You are to
have the pets!"</p>

<p>"But I don't want them! That is, we
can't keep so many!" protested Daddy Martin.
"Two dogs, a cat, a monkey, a parrot,
an alligator and some white rats and mice,
to say nothing of the pigeons! And we have
a dog and cat now, and we just got rid of a
goat and a pony! Oh, I say, my dear Mrs.
Watson! This is too much!"</p>

<p>"Can't help it!" said the housekeeper as
she fastened on her hat. "Uncle Toby said
you were to take charge of his collection of
pets. That's all I know. If he never comes
back&mdash;and I don't believe he ever will&mdash;the
pets are yours to keep. I'd keep them if I
were you&mdash;all except the pigeons. There's<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
a boy down the street who will take them
and be glad to get 'em. The pets are valuable&mdash;especially
Tip and Top, the dogs.
They do tricks separately, but they do more
tricks together&mdash;a sort of team, you know.
Those dogs are very valuable for a show."</p>

<p>"Then I know what we can do," said Mr.
Martin. "We can sell the pets Uncle Toby
left and give the money to a home for children,
or something like that. I'll do it&mdash;we'll
sell the pets!"</p>

<p>In another moment&mdash;just as if they had
been waiting for their father to say this&mdash;there
came a storm of objections from Ted
and Janet. In they ran from the room
where they had been playing with the animals.</p>

<p>"Oh, don't sell 'em!" pleaded Janet.</p>

<p>"Let us keep 'em!" begged Ted. "Those
dogs are the best I ever saw! They can do
dandy tricks! I could get up a show with
them and Skyrocket."</p>

<p>"And this cat and our other cat, too,"
added Janet. "Don't sell Uncle Toby's pets,
Daddy! Let us keep them!"</p>

<p>Daddy Martin looked at his wife. And
then, as if they had been waiting for something
like this, Tip and Top did one of their<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
best tricks. Tip began turning somersaults
again and Top walked around on his hind
legs. Then the two dogs barked, and, without
anyone saying a word to them, they did
another trick.</p>

<p>Tip stopped turning somersaults and
stood still. In an instant Top jumped up
on Tip's back and stood there on his hind
legs. Then Tip walked around the room.</p>

<p>"Oh, aren't they too sweet for anything!"
cried Janet.</p>

<p>"That's a dandy trick!" declared Ted.
"Do, please, let us keep Uncle Toby's pets
for our own."</p>

<p>"Well," said his father slowly, "I don't
see how in the world&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>But at that moment there came a knock
at the door, and the dogs began to bark, the
parrot shrieked, the monkey chattered and
Snuff, the Persian cat, began to mew.</p>

<p>What was going to happen now?</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h3><a name="CHAPTER_VI" id="CHAPTER_VI"></a>CHAPTER VI</h3>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span></p>
<h5>WHERE IS TIP?</h5>

<p>"Someone is at the door," said Mrs. Martin
to Uncle Toby's housekeeper.</p>

<p>"Yes, I hear 'em," answered the queer
little old lady. "I 'spect it's the boy after
the pigeons. I told him to call as soon as
he saw the Curlytops arrive, and he's probably
been watching for you. I'll let him in
as soon as I finish putting on my hat so I
can go."</p>

<p>But before this Mr. Martin, who was nearest
the door, had opened it, and in came a
boy about as old as Teddy, though without
the curly locks of that little lad.</p>

<p>"Can I have the pigeons?" asked the new
boy, taking off his cap and making a little
bow to Mrs. Martin, Mrs. Watson and Daddy
Martin. "Uncle Toby said I could have 'em
if you folks didn't want 'em, and I've been<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
waiting for you to come. I just saw you
get here."</p>

<p>"Yes! Yes! Take the pigeons! Take
any of the animals you want!" begged Mrs.
Martin. "I don't see what in the world we
are going to do with these animals!"</p>

<p>"Oh, keep Tip and Top&mdash;the dogs!"
begged Teddy.</p>

<p>"And Snuff, the cat!" added Janet.</p>

<p>"I 'ike monkey if he don't pull my cap
off," said Trouble. "'Et's keep him!"</p>

<p>"And the white mice and rats wouldn't be
much bother," went on Teddy.</p>

<p>"We never had a parrot that I can remember,"
cried Janet. "I could feed him,
Mother."</p>

<p>"The alligator doesn't make much noise,"
Ted said.</p>

<p>"Dear me! We'll end up by keeping them
all, I see!" laughed the father of the Curlytops.
"That is, all but the pigeons," he
added quickly, as he saw a look of disappointment
on the face of the new boy. "You
may have them, since Uncle Toby promised
them to you."</p>

<p>"The pigeons are all I want," said the
boy, whose name was Bob Nelson. "My
mother won't let me have any of the other<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
pets. And, anyhow, I have a dog and a cat.
Could I get the pigeons now? I've got a
basket and they are so tame I can pick 'em
up. They know me. I used to help Uncle
Toby feed 'em."</p>

<p>"Yes, you may get them," Mrs. Martin
said. "We'll get rid of a few of the pets in
that way. But what we are to do with the
others, I'm sure I don't know."</p>

<p>"You'd better keep 'em," advised Mrs.
Watson, who was now almost ready to go.
"Uncle Toby wouldn't like it, I'm sure, if
you didn't take care of his pets."</p>

<p>"Oh, I wouldn't, for the world, have anything
happen to them, as he was so fond of
them and kind to them," said the mother of
the Curlytops. "But we could sell them to
some animal store, and, as my husband says,
give the money to a home for children.
Uncle Toby would like that."</p>

<p>"Yes, he was very fond of children and
animals," said the housekeeper, as she
seemed about to leave. "It's a pity he never
had any of his own&mdash;any children, I mean,"
she quickly added. "He did have enough
animals. You'd better keep 'em, your children
seem fond of 'em," she added.</p>

<p>"Oh, the Curlytops love animals," agreed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
Mr. Martin. "In fact I like them myself,
especially Tip and Top, the dogs. I never
saw any better trick animals."</p>

<p>Tip and Top had quieted down now, as had
the other animals after Bob had come in to
get the pigeons.</p>

<p>"You'd better keep all of Uncle Toby's
pets," she concluded. "I'm going now.
Just pull the door shut after you and it will
lock. The water is turned off and the house
is all cleaned out. There isn't any food to
spoil, except what the animals need, and you
can take that with you. Uncle Toby said I
was to go as soon as you arrived to have
charge of his collection, and, as you are here,
I'm going. Uncle Toby has hired a man to
look after the house so it will be all right.
Go and get your pigeons, Bob," she added.
"Good-bye, everybody," and away she went.</p>

<p>For a moment Mr. and Mrs. Martin looked
at each other. Then Mr. Nip, the parrot,
broke the silence by saying:</p>

<p>"I'm a crack-crack-cracker!"</p>

<p>"You're a fire-cracker&mdash;at least your
feathers are red enough for that," laughed
Mrs. Martin. "Well, we seem to have the
pets whether we want them or not," she told
her husband. "We can't go away and leave<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
them here. We can't stay in this house, and
try to sell them, if the water is turned off
and there is nothing to eat. I guess we'll
have to take the pets home with us, Dick."</p>

<p>Mr. Martin looked puzzled.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes! Please keep them!" begged
Ted and Janet.</p>

<p>"An' det a han'-ordan fo' de monkey!"
begged Trouble, speaking rather more in
baby fashion than he usually talked, because
he was so excited, I suppose.</p>

<p>"At least we'll have to take charge of
Uncle Toby's pets until we decide what to
do," said Mr. Martin, after a while. "We
might keep some of them and sell the
others."</p>

<p>"Oh, keep them <i>all</i>!" exclaimed Ted.</p>

<p>"We'll see," his father answered, and
from the tone of his voice Ted and his sister
were almost sure they would be allowed to
have all the animals for their very own. Of
course Trouble could hardly expect a hand-organ
to go with Jack, the monkey, but that
was not much of a loss.</p>

<p>"We can't get back home to-night," said
Mrs. Martin, "that's sure. It's too far.
We'll have to stay either here, at Uncle
Toby's house, or at a hotel."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span></p>

<p>"I suppose we could stay here, if we had
to," her husband remarked. "I can turn the
water on, and it is easy enough to get something
to eat, even if we have to buy it at the
delicatessen shop."</p>

<p>"I just love delicatessen stuff, don't you?"
whispered Jan to her brother. "I hope they
get a lot! I'll give some to Snuff, the Persian
cat."</p>

<p>"If we stay it will be just like camping,"
agreed Ted.</p>

<p>While Mr. and Mrs. Martin were considering
what to do, Bob, the boy who had come
for the pigeons, put his head in through the
doorway and called out:</p>

<p>"I got 'em all, thank you! I'm going now.
I hope you have good luck with Uncle Toby's
pets!"</p>

<p>"Goodness knows we'll need it," said Mrs.
Martin, and then she had to laugh. The
whole affair seemed to her to be so very
funny. Neither she nor her husband had
imagined that Uncle Toby's "collection"
could be anything like this&mdash;dogs, a parrot,
a monkey, a Persian cat and a little alligator,
not forgetting the white rats and mice.</p>

<p>"Well, we'd better stay here for the
night," finally decided Daddy Martin. "It<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
is warm, and Uncle Toby had quite a number
of beds. The house is in good order.
I'll turn on the water, and you and the children
might go to the store and get things
for supper," he added. "It will soon be
night."</p>

<p>"Oh, what fun! We're going to stay
here!" cried Janet, dancing around the Persian
cat, who was trying to rub against her
legs.</p>

<p>"And I'll teach Tip and Top some new
tricks, so we can have a circus when we get
home," remarked Ted.</p>

<p>"There's circus enough here," his father
said, with a smile. "But trot along, Curlytops,
if you are going to get something for
us to eat. The animals have been fed and
now it is time for us. I'm getting hungry."</p>

<p>"Me hundry, too!" declared Trouble.</p>

<p>"We mustn't let that happen!" laughed
his mother. "We'll go to the store. Come
along, Curlytops!"</p>

<p>As the children walked down the street
with their mother to look for the nearest
delicatessen store, they saw the boy Bob
carefully wheeling his basket of pigeons toward
his own home. He had gotten the birds
out of Uncle Toby's barn.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span></p>

<p>When Mrs. Martin and the Curlytops,
with Trouble, of course, came back to Uncle
Toby's house, they found Daddy Martin sitting
in front of the kitchen stove in which he
had kindled a fire. In his lap was the Persian
cat, purring contentedly, and Mr. Martin
was rubbing the long, soft silky fur of
Snuff.</p>

<p>In front of the father of the Curlytops
were Skyrocket, Tip, and Top, the three
dogs. They were lying asleep near the fire.
In the other room were the mice, the rats, the
alligator, the monkey, and the parrot, all the
animals quiet, for a wonder, as Mrs. Martin
said.</p>

<p>"Oh, Daddy! you love 'em, don't you?"
exclaimed Jan, as she saw her father surrounded
by some of the pets. "We may keep
them, mayn't we?"</p>

<p>"I'll see about it," was the answer, and
Janet whispered to Teddy that she was almost
sure this meant "yes."</p>

<p>It did not take long to get up a little supper.
Daddy Martin ran the automobile into
the side yard of Uncle Toby's house, and
the Curlytop family, as I sometimes call
them, prepared to stay all night. There were
plenty of beds, and in the morning they could<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
turn off the water again, take the pets away,
close the house, and everything would be as
Uncle Toby wished it.</p>

<p>You can easily guess that neither of the
Curlytops, nor Trouble, for that matter,
wanted to go to bed early that night. The
children were thinking too much of the pets.
And, indeed, the pets seemed to like the children.
Mr. Nip, the parrot, let Jan scratch
his head, a form of caress of which he seemed
very fond. Jack, the monkey, no longer
snatched off Trouble's cap. But perhaps
that was because baby William did not wear
it near the lively chap. Snuff, the Persian
cat, seemed to have taken a great liking to
Mr. Martin, and as for the dogs, Tip and
Top, they were hardly out of the sight of
Jan and Ted. Nor was Skyrocket neglected
or jealous. He entered into the fun of playing
around on the lawn and porch with the
white poodles after supper.</p>

<p>Even Slider, the little alligator, seemed
very friendly. He took bits of meat from
the fingers of Ted, though Janet said she
was afraid of the scaly creature.</p>

<p>"I'm going to teach him some tricks, so
he can be in the animal circus," declared
Ted.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span></p>

<p>"Are you going to have a circus?" asked
his sister.</p>

<p>"Sure!" he answered, though, to tell the
truth, he had not begun to think of it until he
saw all the pets Uncle Toby had left. "We'll
have a fine circus!"</p>

<p>The evening passed pleasantly. Finally
Trouble became sleepy, even though he was
much interested in watching Jack, the monkey,
crack peanuts.</p>

<p>"Come, laddie, you must go to bed!"
called Mrs. Martin. "Mr. Nip, the parrot,
has gone to sleep long ago, with his head under
his wing, poor thing!" and she sang part
of the "Robin Song."</p>

<p>"Me want see head's under swing," murmured
Trouble. "Me see!"</p>

<p>"Oh, no! I don't want to wake up Mr.
Nip. He has a cloth over his cage to keep
him quiet," and Mrs. Martin carried Trouble
over to where the parrot's cage had been
covered with a table-cover for the night.</p>

<p>"Goo'-bye," murmured the little fellow
sleepily, and then he was carried up to his
bed in Uncle Toby's house.</p>

<p>A little later Ted and Janet also went to
their rooms, having given farewell pats and
rubs to the dogs and cat. Mr. Martin went<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
about, seeing that the house was locked up,
and then he and his wife sat downstairs,
talking while the children were asleep.</p>

<p>"Do you really intend to take all those
pets home with us?" asked Mrs. Martin.</p>

<p>"I don't see what else we can do," her
husband replied. "The children will be disappointed
if we don't. And I don't really
want to sell them. Uncle Toby might not
like it. I think I'll take them home with us,
and write to him, if I can get his address.
He must have left it, even if he is going to
live in South America."</p>

<p>"But how can we take home a monkey, a
parrot, three dogs, a cat, an alligator and
some rats and some white mice?" asked the
mother of the Curlytops.</p>

<p>"Oh, there is plenty of room in the auto,"
her husband answered. "We'll load it up
in the morning."</p>

<p>The night passed quietly enough, except
that about twelve o'clock the parrot suddenly
began shrieking:</p>

<p>"Police! Police! Burglars! Police! I'm
a crack-crack-cracker!"</p>

<p>"Dick! Dick! Wake up!" called Mrs.
Martin. "Someone is at the front door!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span></p>

<p>"Police! Police!" chattered the parrot
again.</p>

<p>And, surely enough, it was the police,
though how the red and green bird knew it
is more than I can say. A passing policeman,
seeing the light in Uncle Toby's house,
and having been told by Mrs. Watson, the
housekeeper, on her way to her sister's, that
the place was to be closed, had stopped to
inquire.</p>

<p>"I thought it was burglars," said the policeman,
after Daddy Martin had gone down
to the front door and explained.</p>

<p>"That's what Mr. Nip did, too, I guess,"
said Mr. Martin.</p>

<p>"Who's Mr. Nip?" asked the officer.</p>

<p>"The parrot," said the father of the Curlytops.
"He awakened us by his shrieking."</p>

<p>After the policeman had gone, the house
became quiet again, and nothing more happened
until morning. After breakfast the
water was turned off, and the home of Uncle Toby
was made ready for closing up until
the old gentleman should return.</p>

<p>The parrot's cage, the box for the monkey,
the little tank of water and pebbles in which
Slider lived, and the wire cage of the white
mice and rats&mdash;all these were taken out to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
the automobile. It was a large one, and there
was plenty of room for the Curlytops and
their new pets.</p>

<p>"Take Snuff, the cat, in between you and
Trouble, Janet," her father advised. "Tip
and Top can snuggle down with Skyrocket
on the floor near Ted. Are we all ready
now?"</p>

<p>"As ready as we ever shall be," his wife
answered. "My, what a queer load!" she
said, with a laugh, as she looked back at the
collection and the children. "People will
think we're a traveling menagerie!"</p>

<p>This, however, did not worry the Curlytops.
They liked it, and, a little later, they
were on their way back toward Cresco. The
Curlytops liked their new pets, and they also
loved those they had had for a longer time&mdash;Skyrocket
and Turnover.</p>

<p>"We'll try to get home early," said Mr.
Martin to his wife, as he steered the automobile
through the streets of Pocono.
"We'll have to fix up a place for these pets."</p>

<p>"Yes," agreed his wife.  "They are going
to be quite a care. But the children will love
them."</p>

<p>They stopped for lunch at a little restaurant,
and the children were afraid lest some<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
of their pets might escape while the meal
was being served. But Mr. Martin saw a
young man, sitting in front of a barber shop
next to the restaurant, and said to him:</p>

<p>"Will you watch may automobile and the
animals while we are in the dining room?
I'll give you fifty cents."</p>

<p>"I'll be glad to do it," said the young
man.</p>

<p>So long as he was on guard the Curlytops
were satisfied. But when they came out they
made a sad discovery. Ted jumped up on
the running-board and looked down into the
automobile to make sure all the pets were
safe. The alligator, the parrot, the white
mice and rats, the cat, the monkey, and two
dogs were there. But there was no sign of
Tip, the white poodle with a black spot on
the end of his tail.</p>

<p>"Where is Tip? Oh, where is Tip?" cried
Ted. "He's gone!"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span></p>
<h5>A FUZZY BURGLAR</h5>

<p>"What's that?" asked Mr. Martin, who
was the last of the Curlytop family to come
out of the restaurant. "Who is gone? One
of the pets?"</p>

<p>"Tip is gone," answered Teddy. "Oh,
where is he?"</p>

<p>"Maybe he's hiding back of the monkey's
cage," suggested Janet, for Jack, the pet
monkey, lived in a sort of cage, or box, and
he had been moved from Uncle Toby's house
in it.</p>

<p>"No, Tip isn't here at all," said Teddy.
"Top is here and Skyrocket, but Tip is
gone."</p>

<p>"That can't be," said the young man who
had said he would guard the animals while
the Curlytops ate. "I've been here all the
while, and I didn't see even one of the white
mice get away."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span></p>

<p>He seemed to be a nice, good-natured
young man, and appeared to be as much
surprised as Teddy and Janet were over the
loss of Tip. As for Trouble, he was not
worrying much.  He had climbed into the
front seat of the automobile, and was playing
with Snuff, the yellow Persian cat. As
long as Trouble had some animal near him
he did not worry much about anything else.</p>

<p>"Have you been right here all the while,
young man?" asked Mr. Martin of the youth
who had been left on guard. "You didn't
go away, did you, and give someone a chance
to come up and take one of the dogs?"</p>

<p>"Oh, no, sir! I stayed right here all the
while. I sat down on the running-board and
waited. The only thing that happened was
that the alligator tried to crawl out, but I
put him back. I was sitting here, thinking
how funny it was that anybody should have
so many pets, when, all of a sudden, I felt
something rough on my neck."</p>

<p>"What was it?" asked Janet, while Teddy
was looking under the automobile, thinking
that perhaps Tip might be hiding there.</p>

<p>"It was the little alligator, with his rough
tail," explained the young man, who said he
was called "Shorty" by his chums. He was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
very tall, and perhaps that was why he was
called "Shorty," in fun you know. "It was
the little alligator that was crawling up my
shoulder and scratching my neck," he explained.
"I put him back in his cage, or
tank, or whatever you call it, though I was
afraid he'd bite me."</p>

<p>"Oh, no, Slider is very gentle," said Ted,
who came up on the sidewalk, after having
peered under the automobile. "Oh, dear, I
don't see where Tip can be!" he said.</p>

<p>"It is queer that he should go away and
leave Top," said Mrs. Martin, for the other
white poodle dog was there, safe in the automobile.</p>

<p>Top looked up at the friends gazing down
at him, barked and wagged his tail. Perhaps
he, too, was asking what had become
of his chum, Tip.</p>

<p>"The dog must have jumped out on the
opposite side of the car from where you were
sitting," said Mr. Martin to Shorty.
"Though if that had happened I should have
thought you would have heard him," and the
father of the Curlytops looked rather
sharply at Shorty.</p>

<p>"No, sir, I didn't hear a thing," was the
answer. "All I know is that the alligator<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
tried to crawl up my neck. I didn't see the
dog run away."</p>

<p>"Perhaps he didn't run away," suggested
Mrs. Martin.</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" asked Janet.</p>

<p>"I mean someone may have stepped up
softly, when this young man had his back
turned, and, reaching over, may have lifted
Tip up and taken him away. I wish you
had sat in the auto, Shorty, instead of outside
on the step."</p>

<p>"Yes'm, I wish so myself," agreed the
young man. "But there were so many animals
in there I thought I'd better be on the
outside so I could chase 'em quicker in case
any got away. And one did get away and I
never saw him! I'm terribly sorry! I'll go
down the street and see if I can find him."</p>

<p>"I wish you would," remarked Mr. Martin.
"Just take a look, and ask everyone
you meet if he saw a white poodle with a
black tip on the end of his tail. If you find
him I'll give you a dollar besides the fifty
cents for watching the auto."</p>

<p>"I'd like to earn that dollar!" said the
young man. "I'll go look!"</p>

<p>"I'll come, too," offered Teddy, "but I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
don't want a dollar if I find Tip. I just
want to get our dog back."</p>

<p>"So do I," added Janet. "I'll come and
look with you."</p>

<p>"This was a valuable dog," explained Mr.
Martin, as Shorty moved off down the street.
"He could do tricks. I'd like very much to
get him back."</p>

<p>"I'll do my best," promised the young
man. "It was my fault, in a way, that he
got a chance to go away. I should have been
looking on both sides of the auto at once,
but I didn't. I'll see if I can't find him."</p>

<p>"I think I'll take a look, myself," said
Mr. Martin to his wife, who had now gotten
in the automobile with Trouble. "I don't
like the way things have happened."</p>

<p>"Why, do you think that young man had
anything to do with Tip's going away?"
asked Mrs. Martin, as Ted and Janet went
down the street one way while Shorty took
the other direction.</p>

<p>"I can't be sure," answered the father of
the Curlytops. "He looks like an honest
young man, but if he knew what a valuable
dog Tip was he might have let some friend
of his step up and take away the pet animal."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span></p>

<p>"But wouldn't he have allowed both of
the dogs to be taken&mdash;Top as well as Tip?"
asked Mrs. Martin.</p>

<p>"Maybe there wasn't time to take but the
one," her husband explained. "And perhaps
I am wrong, and Shorty is right. Tip
may have seen some other dog on the far side
of the street, and have jumped out of the car
to go up to him. It's too bad, but maybe
we'll get him back."</p>

<p>"I hope the children don't go so far away
that they are lost, too," remarked Mrs. Martin.</p>

<p>"I think they'll not go far," said her husband.
"Oh, no, you don't!" he suddenly exclaimed.
"Come back here! We don't want
to chase <i>you</i>!" and he made a hasty grab
for Slider, the pet alligator, who seemed to
want to get out of his glass-sided tank. "I'll
be glad when we get Uncle Toby's menagerie
safely home," said Mr. Martin.</p>

<p>"So shall I," his wife added. "Though
the animals seem very nice. Trouble loves
Snuff already."</p>

<p>"Oh, I suppose we shall get to like them
all," agreed Mr. Martin. "We'll have to let
Ted and Janet make places for them in the
barn. It is warm weather now, and even the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
tropical animals, like the monkey, can stay
out there."</p>

<p>"I wonder if the parrot will talk much?"
ventured Mrs. Martin. "I have always
rather wished for a talking parrot. Hello,
Polly!" she called to the red and green bird
in his cage.</p>

<p>"Hello, Polly!" answered Mr. Nip. "I'm
a crack-crack-cracker!" he shouted at the
top of his voice, and several persons, passing
along the street, turned to smile at the Martins
with their automobile load of pets.
Then Mr. Nip began to whistle, so very much
like a boy, that Skyrocket, Ted's dog, imagined
his master was whistling to him, and
barked in answer. Then Top, the remaining
pet poodle, also began to bark, and Jack, the
monkey, chattered in his own queer way.</p>

<p>"I'm a crack-crack-cracker!" Mr. Nip
shouted at the top of his voice, and by this
time quite a little crowd had gathered around
the automobile.</p>

<p>"I wish we were at home!" exclaimed
Mrs. Martin, who did not like so many
strange persons staring at her and her husband
and Trouble. But Trouble, who was
trying to smooth down the fluffy fur of the
Persian cat, did not seem to mind.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span></p>

<p>"What's this&mdash;a traveling circus?" asked
a policeman, stepping up to the side of the
car. "You have to get a permit if you're
going to give a parade," he added to Mr.
Martin.</p>

<p>"Oh, I'm not going to give a parade," answered
the father of the Curlytops. "We
are just waiting to see if we can find one of
our pets, a trick dog that ran away&mdash;or that
was taken away," and he explained what
had happened.</p>

<p>"Do you know anything about that young
man&mdash;Shorty he called himself&mdash;who
watched our auto while we ate?" asked Mrs.
Martin.</p>

<p>"I know him&mdash;yes," the policeman answered.
"Sometimes he is bad, again he is
good. I'd say he was bad more often than
he was good."</p>

<p>"Just what I was afraid of!" exclaimed
Mr. Martin. "I think Shorty knows more
about the missing dog than he has told us. I
don't believe he'll come back to get the dollar
I promised him."</p>

<p>"Here come Ted and Janet," said their
mother. "They didn't find Tip, either."</p>

<p>The Curlytops were hurrying along the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
street toward the automobile. They saw the
policeman and began to run.</p>

<p>"Oh, did you find him? Did you get Tip
back?" gasped Janet, as she reached the
car. "Did the policeman find him?"</p>

<p>"No," answered her mother. "Did you
see anything of our new dog, Curlytops?"</p>

<p>Ted and Janet sadly shook their heads.
They had looked up and down several
streets, they explained, but Tip was nowhere
in sight. Nor had they seen Shorty since
he, also, started to look for the missing animal.</p>

<p>"Well, we can't stay here much longer,"
decided Mr. Martin. "If we do, some more
of Uncle Toby's pets may run away. We'd
better get home. I'll leave you my name and
address," said the father of the Curlytops
to the policeman. "And if you hear anything
of the missing dog please let me
know."</p>

<p>"I will," promised the officer. "And if I
see Shorty I'll make him tell me what really
happened. Sometimes he plays jokes, and
this may have been one of those times."</p>

<p>Mr. Martin waited a little longer, and
when the young man did not come back, and
when there was no sign of the missing Tip,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
it was thought best to start for Cresco. So,
with one of Uncle Toby's pets missing, the
trip was resumed.</p>

<p>"You certainly have pets enough, even
without Tip," said Mrs. Martin, as they
neared the home of the Curlytops.</p>

<p>"Yes, but we want Tip," said Teddy.
"We can't give a good show with only one
trick dog, 'specially when they are supposed
to work as a team&mdash;one on the other's back."</p>

<p>"Are you going to give a show?" asked
his mother.</p>

<p>"Yes," Teddy answered. "We'll give a
show and make money. We can ask real
money to see all the animals we have," and
he looked down at the parrot's cage, the box
of Jack, the monkey, the cage of the white
mice and rats, and the tank of the alligator.</p>

<p>"Perhaps you could train Skyrocket to
take the place of Tip," said Mr. Martin.</p>

<p>"Maybe," agreed Teddy. "But Skyrocket
isn't the same kind of a dog, and Tip
and Top looked so cute together."</p>

<p>"Just like twins," added Janet. "Oh, I
hope we get Tip back."</p>

<p>They could not be sure whether the pet
dog had run away himself, or whether someone
had reached in over the side of the car<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
and lifted him out. Someone may have done
that while Shorty turned his back, saying
nothing and not trying to stop him.</p>

<p>"I am sorry, but I think Shorty had something
to do with Tip getting away," said
Mr. Martin. "If that young man had been
honest he would have come back and told us
he couldn't find the dog. I should not have
allowed Shorty to watch our auto. But it is
too late, now, to be sorry."</p>

<p>The Curlytops reached their home just before
supper, and there was so much to do,
making places in the barn for Uncle Toby's
pets, seeing that they were comfortable, and
that they could not get out during the night,
that, for a time, Ted and Janet forgot about
the loss of Tip. If he had been the only pet,
of course they would have missed him very
much. But they had so many now that they
were kept busy. Still, they wished, very
much, that Tip could be found.</p>

<p>"For if we don't find him, we can't have
half so many tricks in our circus show," said
Teddy.</p>

<p>In due time the pets were put away for
the night. The barn was a good place for
them, and after they had been fed and given
fresh water, which all pets need as much as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
they do food, the children left the animals to
themselves.</p>

<p>"In the morning we'll start getting ready
for the circus," declared Ted.</p>

<p>"Will dey be han'-ordan music?" asked
Trouble.</p>

<p>"Well, we'll have some kind of music, if I
have to toot on some tissue paper over a
comb," answered Teddy.</p>

<p>Tired out with their two days' automobile
trip, the Curlytops were soon ready for bed.
Trouble went to sleep earlier than did Ted
or Janet, but soon they, too, were ready to
go to their rooms.</p>

<p>"Let us feed the animals&mdash;don't you do
it, please," Ted begged of his father and
mother. "Janet and I want to make believe
we are keepers in a circus, feeding lions and
tigers."</p>

<p>"All right, you may feed them," agreed
their mother.</p>

<p>How long they had been asleep neither
Ted nor Janet knew, but they were suddenly
awakened in the night by hearing screams.
The screams came from the open window of
the house next door, where Mrs. Blake, a
very nice lady, lived with her two servants.
Her husband was dead, and her children had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
married and gone away. Mrs. Blake's bedroom
was opposite the adjoining sleeping
rooms of Ted and Janet, and often the Curlytops
would call "good morning" across to
Mrs. Blake.</p>

<p>But this time it was Mrs. Blake who called,
and she did not exactly call, she screamed
in the middle of the night.</p>

<p>"Help! Help!" cried the lady from her
open window. "Mr. Martin! Mary Ann!
Patrick!" (these were her servants) "come
and get him. A little fuzzy burglar is in my
room! Come and get the fuzzy burglar!"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span></p>
<h5>SLIDER GOES SLIDING</h5>

<p>Teddy and Janet, sleeping in their rooms
on the side of their house nearest to the
home of Mrs. Blake, were the first to be
awakened by the screams of the frightened
lady. For that Mrs. Blake was frightened
anyone could tell who heard her cry.</p>

<p>"Come and take the fuzzy burglar! Take
the fuzzy burglar out of my room!" she exclaimed
again and again.</p>

<p>By this time Teddy had jumped out of his
bed and had run to his window. At the same
time Janet, in the next room, had jumped
out of her bed and had run to her window.
Both children looked across the yard to the
home of Mrs. Blake. They could see her, in
the moonlight, standing at her window.</p>

<p>"What's the matter, Curlytops?" called
their mother, across the hall. She had been
awakened, not so much by the cries of Mrs.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
Blake as by the movements of Ted and
Janet. "What's the matter?" asked Mrs.
Martin.</p>

<p>"There's a funny burglar over in Mrs.
Blake's house, and she wants someone to
come and get it," answered Janet.</p>

<p>"No, she didn't say <i>funny</i> burglar&mdash;she
said <i>fuzzy</i>!" declared Ted.</p>

<p>"Well, anyhow, it's a <i>burglar</i>," declared
Janet.</p>

<p>And from the other house again came the
appeal:</p>

<p>"Patrick! Mary Ann! Mr. Martin!
Somebody! Come and get the fuzzy burglar!"</p>

<p>By this time Mr. Martin, who had gotten
up, had been told by his wife that something
was wrong in Mrs. Blake's house. He put
on some clothes and hurried downstairs, carrying
a flashlight in one hand and his revolver
in the other.</p>

<p>"Oh!" exclaimed Janet, who, with Teddy,
watched her father go, "Daddy's going to
shoot the funny burglar."</p>

<p>"<i>Fuzzy</i> burglar!" corrected Ted.</p>

<p>But Janet had covered her ears with her
hands, so she would not hear her father shoot
his revolver&mdash;in case he found anything to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
shoot at&mdash;so the little girl did not hear what
her brother said.</p>

<p>Mr. Martin ran across the lawn to the
front porch of Mrs. Blake's house. By this
time several other neighbors had been awakened
be the lady's screams, and some of the
men came out, partly dressed, to see what
was going on.</p>

<p>"Come in, Mr. Martin," said Patrick, as
he opened the door for the father of the
Curlytops. Patrick was Mrs. Blake's gardener.</p>

<p>"What is it, Patrick?" asked Mr. Martin,
holding his revolver in one hand and the
flashlight in the other. "Where is the burglar?"</p>

<p>"I didn't see anything, Mr. Martin," answered
the gardener. "I heard Mrs. Blake
scream, and I got up, and so did Mary Ann,
the cook, but we can't find anything!"</p>

<p>"But there <i>is</i> a burglar here!" said Mrs.
Blake from the head of the stairs, where she
now stood. "I was awakened by a noise in
my room, and when I looked at the window,
I saw in the moonlight, sitting on the sill,
a fuzzy little old man. He's a burglar, I'm
sure of it, and I wish the police would
come!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span></p>

<p>"I think there are enough of us here now,
Mrs. Blake, to look after two or three burglars
without the police," said Mr. Martin,
as he glanced at several neighbors who had
come in. "Let's have a look around," he
went on. "I fancy, if there was a burglar,
that he has gotten away by this time."</p>

<p>"I hope he has gotten away, and will never
come back," said Mrs. Blake. "But I wish
you gentlemen would look, just the same."</p>

<p>So Mr. Martin and the other men neighbors,
with Patrick, the gardener, to help, began
a search of the house. They went to
Mrs. Blake's room first.</p>

<p>"I don't see any burglar," said Mr. Martin.
He did not need his electric flashlight
now, as the house had been lighted from top
to bottom by Mrs. Blake's two servants.</p>

<p>"There he is! There he is!" suddenly
cried Mrs. Blake. "Under that big chair.
There's the fuzzy burglar!"</p>

<p>Mr. Martin and two or three other men
rushed over to the chair at which Mrs. Blake
pointed. Mr. Martin stooped down, and
then he laughed.</p>

<p>"What's the matter?" asked Mr. Tyndall,
a neighbor from across the street.</p>

<p>"I'll show you," answered Mr. Martin, as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
he thrust his arm under the chair. "Come
out of there, Jack!" he went on, and out
from beneath the chair he pulled&mdash;Jack,
Uncle Toby's pet monkey! Poor Jack was
as much frightened as Mrs. Blake had been,
but he cowered down in Mr. Martin's arms
and looked up into the face of the father of
the Curlytops as if saying:</p>

<p>"Please don't whip me!  I didn't mean
to be bad!"</p>

<p>The men who had come in to help hunt a
burglar looked at the fuzzy monkey in Mr.
Martin's arms, and then burst out laughing.</p>

<p>"Yes, it must have been him that I saw
perched on my window," said Mrs. Blake.
"In my alarm, it did look like a fuzzy, little
old man, and of course I thought it was a
burglar. I was foolish. It was a very small
burglar. I didn't know you kept monkeys,
Mr. Martin."</p>

<p>"I only keep one," he said, "and I don't
exactly keep that, myself. It's one of the
children's pets. It used to belong to my
Uncle Toby, and we just brought Jack home
this afternoon. We put him in the barn with
the white mice and the alligator&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Don't tell me there's an <i>alligator</i> running
around loose!" cried Mrs. Blake. "Oh,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
a monkey is bad enough, but an <i>alligator</i>&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"It's only a little one," said Mr. Martin.
"And I'm sorry Jack got loose and frightened
you. I'll see, after this, that the pets
don't get out at night."</p>

<p>"Oh, I'm sure I don't want to spoil the
children's pleasure in the least," went on
Mrs. Blake. "But I didn't know you had
such a menagerie next door to me, Mr. Martin."</p>

<p>"We didn't have until to-day&mdash;or rather,
yesterday, for it is now past midnight," Mr.
Martin explained. "My Uncle Toby left me
his collection of animals when he went away
suddenly, and Ted and Janet say they are going
to have a circus."</p>

<p>"Save me a ticket!" cried Mr. Hanson,
who lived two or three houses down the
street.</p>

<p>"And I want one," added Mr. Fenton.
"If the Curlytops give a circus I want to
come to it!"</p>

<p>"So do it!" cried several other neighbors,
who had turned out to see what all the excitement
was about.</p>

<p>"I'll tell Teddy and Janet," promised Mr.
Martin, as he carried Jack out of Mrs.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
Blake's house, much to the relief of that
lady, though she was rather fond of animals
in general.</p>

<p>So the excitement quieted down, and after
it was all over a policeman came along, one
of the neighbors having telephoned in the
first alarm. But there was nothing for the
officer to do.</p>

<p>"Now, Curlytops," said Mr. Martin, at
breakfast the next morning when the excitement
of the night was being talked over, "if
you are to keep Uncle Toby's pets here, we
must be careful that they do not bother the
neighbors. Your own dog and cat are very
good, and make no trouble. But with a monkey,
a parrot, another dog and cat, to say
nothing of the alligator and the white mice,
we may cause a lot of trouble to our good
neighbors. And we wouldn't want to do
that."</p>

<p>"What do you want us to do, Daddy?"
asked Ted. He had just fed the two dogs&mdash;Skyrocket
and Top, while Janet had poured
out some milk for Turnover and Snuff, the
two cats.</p>

<p>"We must make cages that can be locked
at night, or else we must make sure that the
barn is tightly closed," said his father. "I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
don't suppose, during the day, that there
will be much trouble. It is at night we must
be careful. No one likes to be awakened by
seeing a monkey on the window sill."</p>

<p>"I wouldn't care," said Teddy.</p>

<p>"Well, ladies like Mrs. Blake don't care
for such thrills," returned Mr. Martin, with
a laugh. "So we must be sure that all the
members of our menagerie are safely caged
each night. I shall depend on you Curlytops
for that."</p>

<p>"We'll be careful!" promised Teddy.</p>

<p>"I'll help you lock up every night," added
Janet.</p>

<p>"Well, then I will leave the pets to you
Curlytops," said their father. "It is on
your account that your mother and I are
keeping them instead of selling them, and
while they will be some care, we do not mind
if you do your share."</p>

<p>"The first thing I'm going to do," said
Teddy, when he and Janet were left to themselves,
their father going to his store, "is to
see how many tricks Top can do."</p>

<p>"Isn't it too bad we haven't Tip?" said
Janet. "They were so cute together!"</p>

<p>"Yes," agreed her brother. "But maybe
I can make Skyrocket let Top ride on his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
back, and teach 'em some other tricks. Come
here, Top!" he called to the white poodle
with the black spot on top of his head.
"Let's see you walk on your hind legs."</p>

<p>Top was very willing to do this, and while
Ted and Janet sat on boxes in the barn, with
their other pets around them, Uncle Toby's
poodle went through his performance. When
he had walked on his hind legs in a little
circle he suddenly sneezed.</p>

<p>"Oh, maybe he's catching cold!" cried
Janet.</p>

<p>"No, I think that was a trick," suggested
Teddy. "Sneeze, Top!" he ordered. Surely
enough, the poodle sneezed, and he would do
it every time Teddy or Janet told him to.</p>

<p>"Oh, he knows two tricks, besides the one
he does with Tip," Teddy said in delight.
"Maybe he does a lot more. I wish Uncle
Toby had written them down, so we'd know
what the dogs can do for our circus."</p>

<p>"We can write to Uncle Toby, when daddy
gets the address, and ask about the tricks,"
Janet said.</p>

<p>"Yes," agreed Teddy, "we can do that.
I wonder if Slider can do any tricks?" he
asked, when Top had been rewarded for his
efforts with a little bone to gnaw.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span></p>


<p>"Do alligators do tricks?" asked Janet, as
she reached in through the bars of Mr. Nip's
cage and scratched the head of the red and
green parrot.</p>

<p>"I guess they do," Teddy answered. "If
they don't we'll teach our Slider to do a
trick. I'm going to take him out of his
tank."</p>

<p>The cage of the little pet alligator was a
sort of tank, in the bottom of which was some
water, and in this were little pebbles, like
those in some goldfish bowls. The tank stood
near a window in the barn where the sun
shone in, for Mr. Martin had told the Curlytops
that their pets who lived in warm, or
tropical, countries must be kept where it was
warm and sunny. That was what they were
used to in their native lands.</p>

<p>So Slider had a warm, sunny place, and
now Teddy took the scaly creature out of the
tank and put him on a box, where the sun
could shine on the long-tailed fellow.</p>

<p>As it happened, there was a long, smooth
board resting on the upper edge of this box
and extending down to the barn floor. Teddy
had laid the board slanting fashion on the
box when he was making room for the cage
of Jack, the monkey.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span></p>

<p>For a little while, after he had been placed
in the warm sun on top of the box, the alligator
remained quiet, slowly blinking his
eyes. Then he began to crawl.</p>

<p>"That isn't much of a trick," declared
Janet.</p>

<p>"Oh, I haven't started to teach him a  trick
yet," her brother answered. "I'm trying to
think what an alligator can do best."</p>

<p>But Slider, as he was called, because he
seemed to slide around in such a slow, easy
fashion, took matters into his own claws, so
to speak.</p>

<p>He crawled around on his box top and
then managed to clamber up on the slanting
board, one edge of which rested on the box.</p>

<p>"I wonder if he is going to slide down-hill,"
said Janet in a low voice, as if she did
not want to disturb the little alligator.</p>

<p>And then, just as if he had made up his
mind to do that very thing, Slider wiggled
along until he was only holding to the edge
of the slanting board by his two hind feet,
while his long tail was only partly on the
box. A moment later, giving himself a hitch
like a boy getting his sled over the top of
the hill, Slider went sliding down the smooth,
slanting board.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span></p>

<p>Down he slid until he reached the barn
floor, and as there was some smooth straw
at the point where the board rested, Slider
slid across this straw for several feet.</p>

<p>"Oh, did you see that?" cried Janet.</p>

<p>"See it? I should say I did!" cried
Teddy. "Slider slid all right! That's going
to be his trick! I'll make a longer board
slide, and I'll put the lower end in a pan of
water, so when Slider slides down he'll make
a splash! That will be a fine trick for the
circus! Come on, Slider, slide again!"</p>

<p>Teddy was just lifting up his pet alligator,
intending to put him on the top of the slanting
board, when Trouble was heard calling:</p>

<p>"Oh, come an' 'ook at Snuff! Come an'
'ook at Snuff! He's doin' suffin' funny!"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span></p>
<h5>MRS. JOHNSON'S BABY</h5>

<p>Teddy and Janet turned their attention
from Slider, the pet alligator whose new
trick they had just discovered, to Trouble,
their little brother.</p>

<p>"What's that you say?" asked Teddy, putting
the alligator back again on the box on
which stood the tank of water.</p>

<p>"You ought to see Snuff," repeated the
little fellow.</p>

<p>"What's he doing?" asked Janet.</p>

<p>"Oh, he's rollin' ober an' ober in yard,"
explained Trouble, so excited that he did
not take time to talk as straight as usual.
"He's rollin' funny!"</p>

<p>"Oh, maybe the poor cat has a fit!" exclaimed
Janet. "That would be too bad,
Ted! He couldn't be in our circus."</p>

<p>"I'll go see," offered Teddy. He had been
among animals so long, and was so kind to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
them, and he liked them so much, that he
was not afraid to try to help even a sick
one. And a cat that has a fit is ill, and needs
medicine. Sometimes Turnover became ill,
and had to be doctored, and more than once
Skyrocket, the dog, was in need of some
simple home remedy.</p>

<p>So the first thought of Janet and Ted,
when Trouble told them that Snuff, the cat
they had brought from Uncle Toby's, was
"rollin'"&mdash;their first thought, I say, was
that Snuff had a fit.</p>

<p>"You stay here and watch Slider," said
Ted to his sister, "and I'll go out into the
yard and see what's the matter with the
cat."</p>

<p>"I go, too," added Trouble. "I 'ike to
see Snuff roll!"</p>

<p>"No, you had better stay here with me,"
suggested Janet, and she ran to the barn
door to catch hold of her little brother before
he could toddle after Teddy.</p>

<p>"I want to go! Lemme go!" cried
Trouble, and he struggled to get away from
Janet.</p>

<p>"No, you must stay with sister," said the
little girl, as pleasantly as she could. "Look,
I'll show you a new trick that Slider, our<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
pet alligator, can do. Trouble like to see
Slider do a trick?" she asked. "Come on,
Trouble! See Slider do his sliding trick!"</p>

<p>Baby William was not proof against this
attraction. He ceased trying to pull away
from Janet and let her lead him back to the
alligator's tank. There Janet took up the
scaly, long-tailed creature, which was idly
crawling around, and put him on top of the
slanting board, as Teddy had been about to
do when Trouble told about Snuff. Janet
did not mind picking up Slider.</p>

<p>The Curlytops were not afraid of animals
that many girls and boys do not like to
handle. Janet and Teddy knew a great deal
about snakes, and they knew that only two
kinds that lived in their State were harmful.
These were the rattlesnake and the copperhead.
All other kinds, such as black snakes,
milk snakes and garter snakes can never
harm a person. Teddy and Janet knew this,
and they had been taught by their father
that these harmless snakes did a great deal
of good by eating rats and mice that, otherwise,
would spoil the farmers' grain.</p>

<p>So it was that Janet had learned to pick
up even large black snakes, knowing they
would not harm her, and once she and her<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
brother had even tamed a good-sized black
snake, so that it would let the children pick
it up, and it would lie, coiled, in their lap.</p>

<p>Snakes can not be tamed, or made to do
tricks like other animals, and the stories of
"snake charmers" are mostly untrue. Some
snakes may rise and sway when music is
played, and the snakes that circus performers
handle are just as harmless as the
garden snakes you see. Some of the larger
ones, however, are very powerful, and can
twist themselves around a person or an animal
strongly enough to kill. But the performers
know how to handle snakes, using
slow and gentle movements, so the reptiles
do not mind it.</p>

<p>Thus it was that Janet had no fear of
Slider, the pet alligator. She lifted him up,
put him on top of the slanting board and,
just as he had done before, Slider went sliding
down.</p>

<p>"Oh! Oh!" cried Trouble in delight.</p>

<p>"Isn't that a good trick?" asked Janet,
laughing with her little brother. "Aren't
you glad you stayed with me."</p>

<p>"Yes, I is glad," declared Trouble. "Now
Trouble make Slider slide."</p>

<p>"All right," agreed Janet.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span></p>

<p>Baby William was not much more afraid
of animals, snakes included, than were
Teddy and Janet. So his sister let him pick
up Slider and give the alligator another
coast down the board hill.</p>

<p>I am not saying that Slider would have
done this trick himself, even after much
practice. It was mostly an accident, I believe,
his coasting down the board when he
got to the slanting edge. The alligator just
naturally crawled around and, reaching the
edge, he fell over, and coasted down. Janet
and Trouble put him close to the edge on
purpose, so he would go down, knowing that
it did not hurt the alligator in the least. I
suppose a mud turtle would have done the
same "trick."</p>

<p>Reptiles have a very small brain, and can
not be taught to do tricks as can dogs, horses
and cats, and the alligator, the turtle and the
snake belong to the class known as reptiles.
So though the children called what Slider
did a "trick," it was more like an accident,
though it was not a harmful one.</p>

<p>"Me make Slider slide," exclaimed
Trouble, and, surely enough, when he had
put Uncle Toby's scaly pet on the board,
down the alligator slid.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span></p>

<p>Trouble and Janet were enjoying themselves
in this fashion, and Janet was wondering
what Teddy was doing, when that young
member of the Curlytop family stuck his
head in through the open barn door and
called:</p>

<p>"Come on out and see Snuff!"</p>

<p>"Oh, has he a bad fit?" asked Janet.</p>

<p>"He hasn't got a fit at all!" answered
Ted. "He's doing one of the best tricks you
ever saw, and it will be dandy in our circus!
Come and look at him!"</p>

<p>"Oh, I'm glad he hasn't a fit!" cried
Janet. "Come on, Trouble!"</p>

<p>But now there was more trouble with
Trouble, for he wanted to stay and play with
Slider.</p>

<p>"Me see Slider slide more!" demanded
the little fellow. And it was as hard for
Janet to get him to come out of the barn
now, as it had been to make him stay in before.</p>

<p>"Oh, come on and see Snuff do his funny
trick!" she begged, and finally Trouble came
away from the alligator.</p>

<p>"And it sure is a funny trick!" laughed
Ted, who had waited for his little brother
and Janet to come out. "Just you see!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span></p>

<p>When the two Curlytops and Trouble hurried
around the corner of the barn, Teddy
pointed to Snuff, the new, big cat that had
been brought from Uncle Toby's house.</p>

<p>Snuff was on top of a large leather ball,
and it was rolling around the yard, with him
on top of it, just as a clown in the circus
stands upright on a large, painted ball, and
rolls himself around the ring. This ball
was a football that Teddy had owned for
some time. The outside was leather, and inside
was a rubber bladder that could be
blown up. It was a round ball, of the kind
used in "Association" games, and not for
"Rugby," which most of the football elevens
play in this country. The "Rugby" ball is
shaped like a watermelon, but the other is
more like a muskmelon, and it was on this
latter kind of a ball that Snuff was rolling
around the yard, just like a circus clown.</p>

<p>"Was this what Trouble meant when he
said Snuff was rolling?" asked Janet.</p>

<p>"Yes," answered Teddy. "I'm glad
Uncle Toby's cat didn't have a fit. Now we
can make him do this trick in our animal
circus."</p>

<p>"Oh, it's a lovely trick," declared Janet.
"I wonder how he learned it?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span></p>

<p>"Maybe Uncle Toby or the lady who
owned him first taught Snuff to roll on top
of a football," Ted answered, while the yellowish
brown cat kept on stepping lightly
this way and that, making the ball turn over
and over. "I guess Trouble left the ball
out here in the yard. He was playing with
it last. Then Snuff must have come out, and
when he saw the ball he remembered that he
knew how to do a trick on it. And he got
up and did it without anyone telling him."</p>

<p>"Maybe he won't do it any more," suggested
Janet.</p>

<p>"We can soon see," Teddy said. "Here,
Snuff!" he called to the big, friendly cat.
"Come over here," and Teddy whistled as
he did for Turnover. Snuff came as he was
called, almost as a dog might do, and Turnover,
also hearing the whistle by which
Teddy summoned him to meals, came running
around the corner of the barn.</p>

<p>"No, we haven't anything for you to eat
now, pussies," said Ted, with a laugh. "But
I'll give you something in a little while if
Snuff does the football trick again."</p>

<p>After petting the two cats, and scratching
them under their ears, which they seemed to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
like very much. Teddy held Snuff in his
arms, and told Janet to take up the football.</p>

<p>"We'll put it down in front of Snuff and
see if he gets up on it," suggested Teddy.
And when this was done the big cat from
Uncle Toby's jumped out of Ted's arms, and
leaped on top of the football, rolling it over
and over just like a clown in a circus.</p>

<p>"Oh, it is a trick&mdash;a real trick!" cried
Janet. "Wouldn't it be great if we could
dress Snuff up in a little suit like a clown?"</p>

<p>"Maybe we can," said Teddy. "But it
will be hard, as cats don't like to have fixin's
on 'em as much as dogs do. I wonder who
taught Snuff that trick? I guess it must
have been Uncle Toby."</p>

<p>And, some time afterward, the Curlytops
learned that it was their father's queer, animal-loving
uncle who had taught Snuff to
roll around on a football.</p>

<p>"I'm terrible glad Uncle Toby left us his
collection, aren't you?" asked Janet of her
brother, when Snuff had grown tired of doing
his trick, and both cats were being fed.</p>

<p>"Yes," agreed Teddy, "I am. First I
thought it might be a collection of stamps or
coins. But I'm glad it was pets."</p>

<p>The Curlytops were going to have a great<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
deal of fun with their pets, they were sure of
that.</p>

<p>"If we only had Tip back," sighed Janet,
as she and Teddy sat watching the cats eat,
talking, meanwhile, about the circus they
were going to have with all their animals.</p>

<p>"Yes, it's too bad one of Uncle Toby's
dogs is gone," agreed Teddy. "Of course
we can do some tricks with Top, but it would
be better with the two of them."</p>

<p>"I wonder if he jumped out of the auto
and ran away, if someone picked him up
off the seat, or if that man Shorty knows
where he is?"</p>

<p>"That's what I wonder, too," replied
Teddy. "And I wonder if we shall ever get
Tip back?"</p>

<p>But many strange things were to happen
to the Curlytops and their pets before this
came about.</p>

<p>Teddy and Janet were so busy talking
about the circus they were to get up with
their animals that, for a time, they did not
watch Trouble. That little chap wandered
back to the barn, for he had been much interested
in watching the alligator do his
trick.</p>

<p>"Me make Slider slide some more," said<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
Trouble, talking to himself, as he had a habit
of doing. Into the barn he toddled. The
alligator was swimming around in his small
tank of water, but, being a tame and pet reptile,
he came out when Trouble stood near
the cage.</p>

<p>Unafraid of animals, as were Teddy and
Janet, baby William picked Slider up and
put him on the slanting board.</p>

<p>Down went the alligator as nicely as you
please!</p>

<p>It was about half an hour after this that
Teddy and Janet decided they would try to
teach their dog Skyrocket some tricks to do
with Top.</p>

<p>"Let's bring 'em both out here in the yard
together," suggested Ted. "You get Skyrocket,
Jan, and I'll hunt Top."</p>

<p>"All right," agreed his sister.</p>

<p>But before they had gone far, looking for
the two dogs, they heard a cry of alarm from
Mrs. Johnson, one of the neighbors across
the street.</p>

<p>"Oh, my baby! My baby!" cried Mrs.
Johnson, as she ran down off the porch toward
a mosquito-netting covered carriage in
the front yard. "A big snake is going to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
sting my baby! Oh, Trouble! what shall I
do?"</p>

<p>"Ha! is Trouble over there?" asked Ted
of Janet.</p>

<p>"Yes, and something else, too, I guess,"
was the answer.</p>

<p>And Mrs. Johnson called again:</p>

<p>"Oh, a big snake is in the carriage with my
baby!"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span></p>
<h5>MR. CAPPER'S BUNS</h5>

<p>Forgetting in the excitement, all about
teaching Skyrocket and Top to do some
tricks together, as Tip and Top did before
Tip was lost, Teddy and Janet ran across
the street toward Mrs. Johnson, who was
standing beside the carriage in which was
her baby. Near her was Trouble, but the
little fellow did not seem to be as excited as
was Mrs. Johnson.</p>

<p>"Trouble," cried Janet, as she took hold
of her little brother's arm, "did you tease
Ruth?" Ruth was the name of Mrs. Johnson's
baby, and though Trouble was, usually,
a good little chap, he might have done something
to make a baby cry, Janet realized.</p>

<p>"I didn't do nuffin'!" declared Trouble.</p>

<p>"Oh, no, Trouble is all right!" said Mrs.
Johnson. "It's a big, black snake that has
crawled into my baby's carriage. I put Ruth<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
out here to have her sleep, and I looked from
the window every once in a while to see that
she was all right."</p>

<p>"And she was, for quite a while. But a
moment ago, when I looked, I saw Trouble
near the carriage, and then I saw a big, ugly
snake crawling over Ruth's robe. Oh, where
is it? Where's the snake, darling? Did the
snake bite you?" and Mrs. Johnson caught
Ruth up from the carriage in her arms.</p>

<p>"I never knew a snake would crawl up
into a baby carriage," said Teddy. "I don't
see any; do you, Jan?"</p>

<p>"No," answered his sister, "I don't!"</p>

<p>"There it is! Look!" cried Mrs. Johnson,
pointing with one hand, while she held Ruth
close to her in her other arm. The baby had
been rather rudely awakened from her sleep,
and she was just getting ready to cry. Her
lips were puckering up, and in another moment
she would let out a yell. Janet and
Teddy knew this, for they had, often enough,
watched Trouble do the same thing when he
was smaller.</p>

<p>"There's the snake!" exclaimed Mrs.
Johnson, and, as she spoke and pointed, the
Curlytops saw something black crawl out<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
from among the folds of the robes in the
baby carriage.</p>

<p>Ted had one glimpse of the head of the
reptile, and then the boy cried:</p>

<p>"That isn't a snake! It's Slider, our pet
alligator! How did he get here?"</p>

<p>"A pet alligator?" cried Mrs. Johnson.
"In my Ruth's carriage! How did it get
here?"</p>

<p>"I bringed it!" said Trouble, in the silence
that followed.</p>

<p>"You what?" cried Janet.</p>

<p>"I bringed Slider ober to play wif Ruff!"
said Trouble. "I play wif Slider in barn,
and den hims hoots get tired, so I bringed
him over to ride in de carriage wif Ruff."</p>

<p>"What does he mean?" asked Mrs. Johnson,
crooning to "Ruff," as Trouble called
the baby, and making the little one quiet.
For William was using some of his "baby
talk," which he often did when he was excited.</p>

<p>"He means that the alligator's feet got
tired, I suppose," translated Janet. "He
says 'hoots' for 'feet.' He must mean that
Slider got tired of sliding down the board."</p>

<p>Mrs. Johnson looked from one Curlytop<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
to the other, and then at Trouble. A puzzled
look was on her face.</p>

<p>"Really, children dear," she said, "<i>you</i>
may know what you are talking about, but <i>I</i>
don't. What with hoots, Slider and a board
I'm all mixed up!"</p>

<p>"I bringed him&mdash;I bringed Slider," explained
Trouble.</p>

<p>"Yes, we know you did that," said Teddy.
"But you shouldn't have, Trouble. It was
wrong to take our pet out of the barn, and
it was wrong to put Slider in the baby carriage."</p>

<p>"Yes, we didn't know Trouble was going
to do anything like this," said Janet, apologizing
for her little brother's misdeed. "But
Ted and I were talking about what tricks
we'd get Skyrocket and Top to do, now that
Tip is gone. And we'd just got through
watching Snuff do a new trick on top of a
football, so we didn't watch Trouble very
much."</p>

<p>"How many pets you have!" exclaimed
Mrs. Johnson. "I suppose those are pets
you have been talking about?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Ours and Uncle Toby's," answered
Teddy. "We have more pets than we ever<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
had before, and we're going to give a circus.
Will you come, Mrs. Johnson?"</p>

<p>"An' bring Ruff!" invited Trouble.</p>

<p>There was a laugh at this.</p>

<p>"If you love Ruth you mustn't put Slider
in her carriage any more," cautioned Janet,
as she lifted the pet alligator out from among
the blankets. "Little babies don't like alligators."</p>

<p>"All wite. I like 'em," said Trouble, and
then he ran back across the street.</p>

<p>"We'll be going now," said Teddy to Mrs.
Johnson. "We're sorry William made
trouble."</p>

<p>"Oh, he didn't mean to," said Ruth's
mother. "He's a dear little fellow. I must
come over and see your pets. Ruth loves a
pussy or a dog, but she doesn't know much
about alligators."</p>

<p>"We have a monkey, too," said Janet.</p>

<p>"And a parrot named Mr. Nip," added
her brother.</p>

<p>"And white rats and mice! They're real
cute!" exclaimed  Janet.</p>

<p>"I don't believe I would like the mice!"
said Mrs. Johnson.</p>

<p>"But ours are white," Janet explained.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>
"That makes a big difference. They're as
nice as rabbits!"</p>

<p>"They wouldn't be for me," said Ruth's
mother, with a laugh. "Good-bye, Curlytops!
Come over again, and bring a pussy
or doggie with you."</p>

<p>Ted and Janet promised they would, and
then they hurried back across the street after
Trouble. They wanted to make sure he
would not get into any more mischief with
the pets.</p>

<p>Daddy Martin was told, that evening after
supper, all that had happened during the
day, from the discovery that Slider and
Snuff could do tricks, to the finding of the
pet alligator in baby Ruth's carriage.</p>

<p>"Well, it seems you had lots of excitement
to-day," he said to his wife.</p>

<p>"Just a little," she agreed.</p>

<p>"But if Uncle Toby's pets are to make
trouble I don't know that we can keep
them," Daddy Martin said.</p>

<p>Teddy and Janet looked at each other.</p>

<p>"Oh, we can't let them go now!" exclaimed
Teddy.</p>

<p>"We're just getting to love them!" his
sister added.</p>

<p>"And we haven't found out any tricks yet<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
that the white mice can do," Teddy went on.
"We haven't even named 'em!"</p>

<p>"Well, I suppose if the neighbors don't
complain I shouldn't," admitted Mr. Martin.
"But with the monkey scaring Mrs.
Blake, and the alligator scaring Mrs. Johnson&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"They weren't very <i>much</i> scared," interrupted
Ted. "Please let us keep Uncle
Toby's pets! We want to give a circus."</p>

<p>"We'll see," said Mr. Martin. "I hope
nothing more will happen, though, to annoy
the neighbors."</p>

<p>"We'll watch our pets so they won't get
out," promised Ted and Janet.</p>

<p>The next few days were spent by the Curlytops
in getting better acquainted with the
animals that had been brought from Uncle
Toby's. They liked their new pets more and
more the more they saw of them. Of course
they wished they could get Tip back, but
that trick dog seemed to have vanished.</p>

<p>Daddy Martin put an advertisement in
the paper, and offered a reward to whoever
would bring Tip back, but there were no answers&mdash;at
least none that amounted to anything.
It is true that several men and boys
came with strange dogs they thought answered<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>
the description of the missing Tip,
but none of the animals was the pet so much
wanted.</p>

<p>Nor was anything heard of the missing
youth "Shorty." He seemed to have disappeared
with the poodle, and the police said
they believed Shorty knew where Tip was,
and had, perhaps, taken him away in order
to sell him.</p>

<p>"Well, of course we have enough animals
without Tip to give a show," said Teddy.
"But I'd love to get Tip back. And I guess
Top is lonesome without him."</p>

<p>"I guess so, too," added Janet.</p>

<p>But if Top was lonesome he showed no
signs of it after one or two days. He made
friends with Skyrocket, as Snuff did with
Turnover, and the dogs and cats lived happily
together.</p>

<p>But alas for the hopes of Mr. Martin that
his neighbors would not again be troubled
by the pets of the Curlytops. It was about
a week after the animals had been brought
from Uncle Toby's house that, as Mr. Martin
was coming home from the store rather early
one afternoon, he saw a crowd in front of
the bakeshop of Mr. Capper, just around the
corner from the home of the Curlytops.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span></p>

<p>"I hope that isn't a fire in Mr. Capper's
bakery," thought Daddy Martin, for more
than once hot grease had boiled over in the
bakeshop and caused slight fires.</p>

<p>As Mr. Martin approached Mr. Capper's
store he heard loud laughter from the crowd
of men  and boys in front of the show window.</p>

<p>"It can't be a fire, or they wouldn't
laugh," said the father of the Curlytops. "I
wonder what it is?"</p>

<p>He hastened on, and as he came within
view of the bakery window he uttered an exclamation
of surprise. For there, among the
buns, eating them and playing among the
other cakes, were several large white rats
and mice.</p>

<p>"Look at that one big one stand up on his
hind legs and nibble a bun just like a squirrel!"
said a man watching the antics of the
white rats and mice among Mr. Capper's
buns. If this man had only known it, squirrels
and rats belong to the same family, that
called "rodents," only a squirrel has a much
larger tail than a rat or a mouse.</p>

<p>"I wonder what in the world Mr. Capper
lets those white rats stay in his bakeshop
window for?" thought Mr. Martin, as he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
ran up. "They are not harmful, of course,
but people will not like to eat bakery stuff
after rats and mice, even if they are white,
have run around them. It's a poor advertisement."</p>

<p>At that moment the baker himself, who
had been out in his oven-room, came running
into the shop. He gave one look at his window,
saw the white rats and mice playing
around in and nibbling his choice buns, and
then the baker cried:</p>

<p>"Oh, who did this? Who played this trick
on me and spoiled my buns? Who let those
mice in there?"</p>

<p>"Didn't you do it yourself?" asked Mr.
Martin, who knew the baker very well, having
traded with him for a number of years.</p>

<p>"Let those mice in my window? Never!"
cried Mr. Capper. "Why should I do a
thing like that?"</p>

<p>"I thought maybe it was for an advertisement&mdash;to
attract customers to your store,"
said Mr. Martin. "Though I thought it was
rather funny."</p>

<p>"It is too funny!" cried the baker. "All
my buns are spoiled, and I just baked them.
As for customers&mdash;I have a crowd, yes, but
they will not buy what the mice have nibbled.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span></p>

<p>"Whose mice are they? Whose white
rats are they? I ask you that!" cried the
baker, who was much excited. "A little
while ago two boys come in to buy cookies.
I wait on them, and I go back to my oven.
Then the next I know I see a crowd and I
come out to find&mdash;these!"</p>

<p>He pointed to the white rats and mice
that were having a fine time among the buns
in the bakeshop window.</p>

<p>"You say two boys were here a little while
ago?" asked Mr. Martin, and he began to
have a suspicion of what had happened.</p>

<p>"Two boys," replied the baker. "They
have a box with them&mdash;Ha! here is the box
now. It is the cage that the mice got out
of!" he cried, pointing to a box with a wire
front on the floor of the store, in a corner.</p>

<p>"Uncle Toby's box!" exclaimed Mr. Martin,
in a low voice.</p>

<p>"What's that?" cried the baker. "You
know these white rats and mice, Mr. Martin?"</p>

<p>"I'm afraid I do," said the father of the
Curlytops. "My children got some new pets
from an uncle of mine&mdash;Uncle Toby. Among
the pets were white mice and rats. That is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
the box we brought them in from Pocono.
But how did the box get here?"</p>

<p>"Some boys brought it in, I am telling
you," the baker answered. "Two boys."</p>

<p>"Did you know them? Was one my son
Teddy?" asked Mr. Martin.</p>

<p>"I do not know&mdash;I forgot to look I was
in such a hurry, for my bread was almost
burning in my oven. I run to the store
quick, as I am all alone now; I wait on the
boys, they want cookies; and I run back to
my oven. Now I come&mdash;the rats&mdash;the mice!"
and Mr. Capper, who was a Frenchman,
raised his hands in the air over his head in
despair.</p>

<p>"I wonder if Ted could have done this?"
mused Mr. Martin.</p>

<p>And then he heard Teddy's voice calling:</p>

<p>"Come on, Jim! Here they are! We left
the rats here, and&mdash;Oh, I say! Look! They
got out of the cage, and look what they're
doing to the buns!"</p>

<p>A moment later Teddy Martin came pushing
his way through the crowd now in the
bakery.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span></p>
<h5>TOP ACTS STRANGELY</h5>

<p>Mr. Martin, the father of the Curlytops,
Mr. Capper, the baker, and the crowd of
persons in the shop looked at Teddy and his
friend, Jimmy Norton, as the two boys hurried
into the place. Nearly everyone guessed
what had happened, but Mr. Martin wanted
to make sure, so he asked:</p>

<p>"Teddy, did you let your white mice and
rats get loose among Mr. Capper's buns?"</p>

<p>"Well, I&mdash;I didn't exactly do it, Daddy,"
Teddy answered. "But I guess they did get
loose, didn't they?" he asked, with half a
smile.</p>

<p>"There is no doubt about it&mdash;they are
loose, and they have done a lot of damage,"
and Mr. Martin spoke rather sternly.</p>

<p>"Damage! They have eaten up over two
dollars' worth of buns&mdash;or they have as much
spoiled!" said the excited baker.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span></p>

<p>"How did it happen?" asked Teddy's
father.</p>

<p>"Well, it was an accident," the little Curlytop
boy answered. "Jimmy and I were
taking the cage down to the store to have
some new wire put on. There's a place
where the wire is broken, and it needed fixing
so the rats couldn't get out. So Jimmy
and I took the cage, and the rats and mice in
it, down to the hardware store."</p>

<p>"Why didn't you take the mice out, and
leave them in the barn?" asked Mr. Martin.</p>

<p>"'Cause there wasn't anything I could
leave 'em in," Teddy replied. "I was afraid
they'd get out, and maybe go over in Mrs.
Johnson's baby carriage, just as Slider did.
So I thought if we took the rats and mice
right in the cage the man at the store could
put some new wire netting over the old, and
they couldn't get out."</p>

<p>"And did he do it?" Teddy's father went
on, while the crowd listened to the talk.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," Teddy replied. "The cage was
fixed all right, and on the way back, Jimmy
and I got tired of carrying it, so we stopped
in here to get some cookies. We were hungry."</p>

<p>"It is as I told you!" broke in Mr. Capper.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
"Two boys did come in for cookies.
These are the two&mdash;I remember now."</p>

<p>"Well, why didn't you boys take the cage
of rats and mice with you when you went
out?" asked Mr. Martin. "If you hadn't
left them here they wouldn't have gotten
loose and gone into Mr. Capper's show window
to eat or spoil all his buns. Why did
you leave the cage here?"</p>

<p>"We&mdash;we forgot it, I guess; didn't we,
Jimmy?" asked Teddy of his chum.</p>

<p>"Yes," agreed Jimmy, "we did."</p>

<p>"But if the man at the hardware store put
new wire on the cage, I don't see how the
rats and mice got out," Mr. Martin went on.</p>

<p>Teddy looked at the empty cage which had
been set down in a corner when he and his
chum bought the cookies.</p>

<p>"The door came open!" Teddy exclaimed.
"See, Daddy, the door sprang open and the
white mice got out that way. It wasn't our
fault at all!"</p>

<p>"But it was your fault for leaving the
cage here," went on Mr. Martin. "I don't
see why you did it."</p>

<p>"I guess it was on account of the fire engine,"
spoke up Jimmy Norton.</p>

<p>"The fire engine!" cried Teddy's father.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
"What has the fire engine to do with white
mice eating buns?"</p>

<p>"Well, after we'd bought the cookies, and
were going to take up the cage of mice and
go out," Jimmy explained, "the fire engine
came past, and Ted and I ran out to see it
and we went to the fire, but it wasn't a big
one, and we forgot about the mice; didn't
we, Teddy?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Teddy, "we did. And I
didn't think about 'em until a little while
ago, 'cause we started to play marbles, and&mdash;and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes, and by your thoughtlessness you
have made a lot of trouble," Mr. Martin
remarked. "I am sorry for this, Teddy. If
many more things happen I shall have to get
rid of Uncle Toby's pets."</p>

<p>"Oh, don't do that!" begged the little
Curlytop boy. "I'll put the rats and mice
back in the cage and I'll fasten the door so
they can't get out again. Don't send Uncle
Toby's animals away, Daddy! We want to
have a circus with them!"</p>

<p>"And I'll help pay for the buns the rats
ate," added Jimmy. "It was partly my
fault for making Ted forget."</p>

<p>"Oh, no, I can't allow that," said Mr.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
Martin, "though it is very good of you to
offer, Jimmy. I will pay Mr. Capper for
the buns the rats ate, and after this Teddy
must be more careful."</p>

<p>"Can we take away the buns and cookies
the mice didn't eat?" asked the little Curlytop
chap, as he and his chum began picking
up the pets and putting them back in the
cage. The animals were tame and did not
mind being handled.</p>

<p>"Take away all the buns in the window!
They are of no more use to me!" exclaimed
the baker. "But, Mr. Martin, I will not
charge you full price for the things&mdash;only
what it cost to make them. For, as you say,
it was an advertisement. And I know the
boys did not mean it."</p>

<p>"Indeed we didn't!" cried Teddy. "We
can take the broken buns and feed them to
Skyrocket and Top, and Mr. Nip and Jack
will eat them, too," he said to his father.
"It will be just as good as buying stale bread
for the monkey and the parrot, Daddy. I
guess they'll like buns better."</p>

<p>"I shouldn't be surprised if they did,"
laughed Mr. Martin. "Well, as you say,
Teddy, it will save buying stale bread."
Some of the pets were fed on this, and now<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
the broken buns would take its place for a
few meals.</p>

<p>By this time the crowd began leaving the
bakery, as the excitement was over. Teddy
and Jimmy picked up the last of the rats and
mice, putting them back in the mended cage.</p>

<p>"And make sure the door of the cage is
fastened," Mr. Martin said to Teddy, as the
baker was paid for the buns. "We don't
want the creatures getting loose again."</p>

<p>"It's good and tight," Teddy said. "They
won't get out again except when we take
them out to do circus tricks."</p>

<p>Carrying the cage of white mice and rats
between them, Teddy and Jimmy walked
down the street in front of Mr. Martin, and
soon the pets were safely back in the barn.</p>

<p>"I'm a crack-crack-cracker!" cried the
green, red and yellow parrot, as the boys
entered. The talkative bird whistled, at
which sound Skyrocket and Top, who were
asleep in one corner of the barn, awakened
and began to bark loudly.</p>

<p>"Your parrot whistles just like one of us
fellows," said Jimmy to Teddy.</p>

<p>"Yes, he does," admitted the Curlytop
chap. "I have been trying to think what
tricks we could make him do in the circus.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>
But the trouble is he doesn't always talk or
whistle when you want him to. And when
you don't want him to he nearly always does
it."</p>

<p>"Well, anyway, he'll be nice to look at in
the pet circus," said Jimmy. "And in the
regular circus they have animals and birds
to look at, as well as the kind that do tricks."</p>

<p>"Yes," agreed Teddy, "I guess so."</p>

<p>"I'm a crack-crack-cracker!" shrieked
the parrot again, pulling himself up to the
top of his cage by means of his big beak, his
black tongue licking the bars as if he liked
them.</p>

<p>"Well, if you're a crack-crack-cracker,
here's a bun-bun-bunner for you," laughed
Teddy, and out of the bag Mr. Martin had
carried from the bakeshop Teddy took several
of the broken pieces and fed them to
the parrot.</p>

<p>Seeing this, Jack, the monkey, who was in
his cage, set up a chattering such as he must
have learned in the jungle where he came
from.</p>

<p>"What's the matter with him?" Jimmy
wanted to know.</p>

<p>"I guess he wants some of the broken buns,
too," said Teddy. "Here, you give the monkey<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>
some, and I'll feed Skyrocket and Top.
They want some, too."</p>

<p>Soon such of Uncle Toby's pets as liked
this form of food were having all the buns
they wanted. Mr. Nip, the parrot, tore his
pieces of the buns apart to get at the currants.
But Jack, Top and Skyrocket ate
theirs down, currants and all, as if they liked
every crumb.</p>

<p>The white rats and mice were not given
any of the broken buns, as it was thought
they had had enough in the bakery, and
Teddy knew it was not wise to overfeed any
pet animals.</p>

<p>Cats, dogs and other pets should not be
fed too much, though of course they should
not be allowed to go hungry very long. When
animals can run around as they please, or
when they live wild in the jungle or forest,
they never eat too much. They know when
to stop. But often persons, wishing to be
kind, will give their dogs and cats too much
meat, or other rich food. And as these pets
do not run around and exercise very much,
they cannot digest all they eat, so they often
become ill. Teddy did not want this to happen
to any of his pets.</p>

<p>Another thing he was careful about was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
always to see that they had plenty of fresh
water. Nothing is more important than this.
It is cruel to have any pet suffer for water
to drink, especially in summer. So if you
keep pets of any kind, don't feed them too
much, but give them plenty of water. They
never can take too much of this.</p>

<p>"When you going to have your circus?"
asked Jimmy of Teddy, when the animals
had quieted down, eating the pieces of buns.</p>

<p>"Oh, pretty soon, I guess. Janet and I
are going to teach them a lot of new tricks."</p>

<p>"I wish I could help," said Jimmy.</p>

<p>"You can," Teddy promised. "Jan and I
will need someone to help us with the circus.
I'm going to ask Jack Turton and Harry
Kent, too. Jack is so funny and fat he'll
make a good clown."</p>

<p>"I'd rather be one of the animal trainers,"
said Jimmy.</p>

<p>"That's what you and I'll be&mdash;animal
trainers," decided Teddy. "My sister Jan's
good with animals, too. She isn't afraid of
even a snake."</p>

<p>"That's good," decided Jimmy. "Maybe
we could get some snakes to have in the circus&mdash;little
ones, you know."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span></p>

<p>"It would be fine!" exclaimed Teddy.
"But where can we get any?"</p>

<p>"Oh, in the woods, I guess. I'll see if I
can find any. But I've got to go home now."</p>

<p>"All right. Come over to-morrow and
we'll start training the animals," replied
Teddy.</p>

<p>And the next day Teddy, Janet and Jimmy
began to teach the pets some new tricks. I
will tell you about them when the time comes.
It was not easy work, and more than once
the Curlytops and their friend were discouraged.
For just when they thought they
had Top and Skyrocket so they would do a
trick together, one or the other of the dogs
would run away, wagging his tail, however,
in friendly fashion, to show there were no
hard feelings.</p>

<p>The cats were the hardest to teach. Snuff
did very well with his ball rolling trick and
one or two others, and Turnover would turn
in a sort of side-somersault whenever told
to do so by Janet. But to teach the two cats
to do tricks together was much harder.</p>

<p>It was this&mdash;the tricks they could do together&mdash;that
made Tip and Top such a valuable
team of dogs.</p>

<p>"Do you think you'll ever get Tip back?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
asked Jimmy, as he, with the Curlytops, was
resting one day after putting the pets
through some of their tricks.</p>

<p>"We keep hoping so," said Janet.</p>

<p>"But it doesn't look so now," added her
brother. "He's been gone so long, and not
even the police can find him. They can't
find Shorty, either. I guess Shorty and Tip
ran a way together."</p>

<p>"And maybe Shorty has Tip in a circus,
making him do tricks," added Janet.</p>

<p>"Maybe," agreed Teddy. "But now
we've got to think where we're going to get
a tent for our show. If we give a pet animal
circus we've got to have a tent."</p>

<p>"Sure!" agreed Jimmy. "It wouldn't be
a circus without a tent. But maybe my
father can get us one. He used to be in the
army."</p>

<p>"Oh, let's go ask him!" cried Janet. "We
can leave our pets here in the barn now, for
they've been fed and watered."</p>

<p>Off the children hurried to Jimmy's house.
His father was not at home, but Mrs. Norton
said she thought her husband could get a
tent that would do for the circus.</p>

<p>"And since you have been feeding the animals,
wouldn't you like to feed yourselves<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
now?" asked Jimmy's mother, with a smile
at the Curlytops and her own son.</p>

<p>"Feed ourselves&mdash;how?" asked Teddy.
At the same time he noticed a most delicious
smell coming from Mrs. Norton's kitchen.</p>

<p>"I have just baked some molasses
cookies," went on Jimmy's mother, "and I
have some lovely, cool milk. Would you like
some glasses of milk and molasses cookies?"</p>

<p>"Sure!" exclaimed Teddy.</p>

<p>"Fine!" cried Jimmy.</p>

<p>"We'd like it very much, if you please,"
said Janet, and she was extra polite, to make
up for the rather boisterous manner in which
Teddy spoke. But the boys meant to be polite
and, after all, that is what counts.</p>

<p>Soon the Curlytops and their friend were
out on the side porch, drinking the cool, rich
milk and eating the fresh molasses cookies.
It was while they were thus sitting, talking
about the circus they were going to give, that
into the yard came running Top, Uncle
Toby's trick dog.</p>

<p>"Hello, Top!" called Teddy. "Were you
looking for us?"</p>

<p>Top barked and wagged his tail. Then he
acted in a strange manner. He ran up to
Teddy, and caught hold of the boy's coat.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, he's trying to bite you!" exclaimed
Janet.</p>

<p>"He is not! Top would never bite me!"
declared Teddy. But he wondered what the
dog was trying to do.</p>

<p>Then Top let go his hold of the coat, and
ran a little way toward the gate. There he
stopped and looked back toward the children.</p>

<p>"What makes him act that funny way?"
asked Jimmy.</p>

<p>"I don't know," answered Teddy.</p>

<p>With another bark, and wagging his tail,
Top again ran up to Teddy and pulled on
his coat.</p>

<p>"I know what it is!" exclaimed the Curlytop
boy. "Something has happened, and
Top has come to tell us and get us to go
with him! Come on, Jimmy! Come on,
Jan!"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span></p>
<h5>MR. NIP'S ALARM</h5>

<p>Together the two Curlytops and their
friend Jimmy Norton ran out of Jimmy's
yard and down the street, following Top, the
trick dog. For as soon as Top had seen that
Teddy was following after him, which, evidently,
was just what Top wanted, the dog
raced on, barking wildly.</p>

<p>"Do you think he came to call you?"
panted Janet, as she ran beside her brother.</p>

<p>"Sure he did," Ted answered. "Didn't
you ever read in books how dogs do that
when they want you to come to help somebody
who's in trouble&mdash;like somebody in the
water?"</p>

<p>"I've read lots of stories like that," said
Jimmy.</p>

<p>"Oh, maybe something has happened to
Trouble!" cried Janet.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span></p>

<p>"Mother took Trouble down town with
her," Teddy answered. "So if Trouble is
in trouble Top wouldn't know it."</p>

<p>"Maybe our house is on fire," went on
Janet, who seemed quite determined to have
something dreadful happen.</p>

<p>"You'd hear the alarm bell and see the
engines if there was a fire," declared Jimmy.</p>

<p>"Well, it's <i>something</i>!" exclaimed Janet.
"Isn't it a pity dogs can't talk like parrots?
If they could, Top could tell us just what
the matter was."</p>

<p>"We'll see pretty soon," said her brother.
"We're almost at our house, and it must be
there that something is the matter."</p>

<p>As the children were racing down the
street, with Top running in front of them,
looking back every now and then to make
sure the Curlytops and Jimmy were following,
a man stopped the children and said:</p>

<p>"Why are you chasing that poor dog?
Don't you know it is wrong to tease and annoy
animals?"</p>

<p>"We're not teasing him," Teddy answered.
"He's our dog, anyhow."</p>

<p>"That is no matter," the fussy man said.
"I think it is wrong to chase dogs or to tie
tin cans on their tails."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span></p>

<p>"As if we'd tie a tin can to the tail of our
nice Top!" exclaimed Janet. "We <i>never</i>
tie cans to dogs' tails!" she added. "And
we're running after Top because he wants us
to. He came to get us because something
has happened at our house."</p>

<p>Seeing that the children had stopped, because
the strange man had halted them, Top
came running back, barking and wagging
his tail. He caught hold of Teddy's coat,
and again pulled it.</p>

<p>"See!" exclaimed Ted. "He wants us to
follow him. He did that before, and that's
why we ran after him, not because we're
chasing him, Mister."</p>

<p>The man looked at the excited dog and at
the kind-faced children. He must have
known they would never have harmed animals,
for he said:</p>

<p>"Oh, excuse me! I guess I made a mistake.
I thought you were chasing the poor
dog. Excuse me!"</p>

<p>The strange man turned and hurried off
down the street, and after looking toward
him for a few seconds the Curlytops and
their chum again hastened along, following
Top, who grew more excited all the while.</p>

<p>Into the yard of the Martin house dashed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
Top, closely followed by the children. But
the dog did not stop at the house, nor did he
run toward the barn where the other pets
were kept. When Ted, Janet and Jimmy
went over to Jimmy's house they had left the
two dogs and the two cats playing outside
the barn. Now there was no sight of Snuff
and Turnover, nor of Skyrocket, the other
dog.</p>

<p>Down past the barn and toward the brook
into which Trouble had more than once fallen,
ran Top, the trick dog.</p>

<p>"Oh, Trouble must have come back and
have fallen in!" cried Janet.</p>

<p>"I don't believe so," said her brother.
"If Trouble was in the water you'd hear
him howling."</p>

<p>"Unless his head was under," suggested
Jimmy.</p>

<p>"Yes, unless his head under," agreed
Teddy. "But I don't believe it's Trouble.
If it was anything like that, Top wouldn't
come all the way to your house after us,
Jimmy. He'd have barked and have gotten
someone around here to come to the rescue."</p>

<p>"There isn't anybody home at our house
but us, and we weren't home," explained<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>
Janet. "Mother and Trouble are down
town, and Susan, our new girl, has gone
out."</p>

<p>"I guess that's why Top came to us,"
Teddy said. "But where is he going, anyhow,
and what is the matter?"</p>

<p>Barking and still wagging his tail, to show
how glad he was that the children were coming
where he wanted them, Top led the way
down along the brook. The Curlytops
passed the place where they had played ships
the day Trouble was sent afloat in the box&mdash;the
day Uncle Toby's letter came, telling
about the pets he was leaving.</p>

<p>"What is it, Top? What's the matter, old
fellow?" asked Teddy.</p>

<p>A bark was the dog's answer. But a moment
later, as the children turned a bend in
the stream, they heard a howl coming from
a bunch of tall cat-tail plants growing on
the edge of a swamp not far from the brook.
It was the mournful howl of a dog in pain.</p>

<p>"That's Skyrocket!" cried Teddy.</p>

<p>"And he's in trouble!" added Janet.</p>

<p>"And that's why Top came to get us,"
declared Jimmy.</p>

<p>Top was barking louder than ever now,
and as the Curlytops and their friend hurried<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>
along they could hear, more plainly, the
howls of the dog they felt sure was their
own, dear Skyrocket.</p>

<p>And a moment later, as they parted the
green spears of the cat-tails, they saw, lying
on the ground in the mud and water, poor
Skyrocket. Their pet looked up at them
and howled mournfully.</p>

<p>"Oh, he's drowning!" cried Janet, as she
saw that Skyrocket was partly covered by
the water of the swamp.</p>

<p>"He's got a broken leg!" said Jimmy.</p>

<p>"Dogs can go on three legs, if one is broken,
though they can't go very fast," said
Teddy. "Skyrocket is caught fast, that's
what's the matter."</p>

<p>Top seemed overjoyed that he had brought
help to his dog friend. Close up beside Skyrocket
Top crawled, whining in sympathy,
and then Top began licking, with his red
tongue, one of Skyrocket's legs.</p>

<p>"Oh, I see what the matter is!" cried
Teddy. "Skyrocket's leg is caught in a trap!
That's why he couldn't get loose! Look!"</p>

<p>Teddy pointed to where, half hidden in
the mud, water, and grass, was a spring trap.
It was fast to a chain, and the chain was
attached to a wooden stake, driven into the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
ground. But, worst of all, the steel jaws of
the trap had snapped shut on the lower part
of Skyrocket's left hind leg. The poor dog
tried to stand up, but could not, as whenever
he attempted to move the chain held him
back.</p>

<p>"Poor Skyrocket!" murmured Janet, almost
ready to cry.</p>

<p>"I'll get him loose!" said Teddy.</p>

<p>"It's a good thing Top came and told us
what the matter was, or maybe we'd never
have known it," remarked Jimmy.</p>

<p>"Come on, Jim! Help me open the trap
and get Sky's leg out," said Teddy. "You
pat his head&mdash;I mean Sky's head, Jan, and
that will let him know we aren't going to
hurt him."</p>

<p>So while Top looked on, whining in sympathy
with his injured dog friend, and while
Janet softly rubbed the head of Skyrocket,
the two boys opened the trap. While Jimmy
held it steady Teddy stepped on the strong
spring with his foot. This was the only way
to open it.</p>

<p>In another moment the trap was gently
pulled loose from the leg of Skyrocket, and
the poor dog, with a whine of thanks, managed
to stand up. He tried to step on the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>
injured leg, but quickly drew it up with a
howl of pain.</p>

<p>"Oh, maybe it's broken!" half sobbed
Janet.</p>

<p>"A dog can get well with a broken leg, but
a horse can't," said Jimmy. "At least a
horse never does, because he is so big he can't
be kept off his leg until it heals.  A horse
can't go on three legs like a dog."</p>

<p>"A horse can stand up on two legs, and
walk a little. I've seen 'em in a circus!"
declared Janet. "But I never saw a horse
go on three legs."</p>

<p>"There goes Skyrocket on three legs!"
called Teddy, for his pet hobbled along a
little way, to a drier part of the swamp, and
then lay down and began licking with his red
tongue the leg that had been caught in a
trap.</p>

<p>"Look and see if it's broken," suggested
Jimmy. "If it is, we'd better tie sticks
around it like the principal of our school did
one day when Tommy Hicks broke his leg."</p>

<p>"I remember that time," responded
Teddy. "Easy now, old fellow," he said to
Skyrocket. "Let me feel your leg to see if
it is broken."</p>

<p>Gently, very gently, Teddy moved his fingers<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>
along the injured leg. Skyrocket
whined a little, but remained lying there
quietly. At last Teddy stood up.</p>

<p>"I don't believe it's broken," he said. "I
guess it was only pinched hard in the trap."</p>

<p>"It's a smooth-jawed trap, not the kind
with the teeth like a saw," said Jimmy, looking
at the trap which had been allowed to
spring shut after Skyrocket's leg was drawn
out. "They use big traps, with terrible
sharp teeth and jaws, to catch bears," said
the little boy.</p>

<p>"I'm glad this wasn't that kind of trap,"
said Janet. "But who put it here, anyhow?"</p>

<p>"It's an old one, and rusty," went on
Jimmy, looking at the trap, while Teddy got
some water from the swamp in the top of
his cap, and poured it over the bruised place
where Skyrocket's leg seemed to hurt most.
The water appeared to ease the pain a little,
and the dog whined gratefully. Top, now
that his work of bringing someone to the
rescue was over, stretched out in a cool place
and rested, breathing with his mouth open
and his tongue hanging out. This is the way
dogs always cool themselves.</p>

<p>"Yes, it's an old, rusty trap," agreed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
Teddy, coming up to look at the thing that
had caught Skyrocket.  "I guess some muskrat
hunter left it here, all set and ready to
catch some animal that came along, ever
since last winter. Maybe the spring was
rusty, and not so strong, and that's why it
didn't break Skyrocket's leg."</p>

<p>"I'm glad it didn't!" voiced Janet.</p>

<p>"So'm I," echoed Jimmy.  "But how are
you going to get Skyrocket home?"</p>

<p>"Oh, it isn't far, and he can go on three
legs," said Teddy. "Come on, old fellow,"
he called, and Skyrocket managed to hobble
along the brook path and up to the house.
Top walked along beside him, every now and
then putting out his tongue and gently licking
his companion.</p>

<p>"He's kissing him 'cause he's sorry," observed
Janet.</p>

<p>"We're all sorry," declared Teddy. "I'm
going to ask mother if we can't have the animal
doctor look at Skyrocket's leg."</p>

<p>"Why, children! what is the matter? Has
anything happened, Curlytops?" asked Mrs.
Martin, who had reached home with Trouble
by the time the two boys and Janet made
their way up the back path to the house.</p>

<p>"Skyrocket's leg was caught in a trap,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>
and can't we have the animal doctor see if
it's broken?" Teddy asked.</p>

<p>Then the story was told, not forgetting the
brave and intelligent part played by Top,
and Mrs. Martin examined Skyrocket's sore
leg.</p>

<p>"I don't believe it is broken, but we'll
have the doctor look to make sure," she said.</p>

<p>And you can just imagine how glad the
Curlytops were, and Jimmy also, when the
doctor said:</p>

<p>"The leg is not broken, but it is badly
bruised. However, it will be well in a week
or so. Keep Skyrocket as quiet as you can."</p>

<p>"We will!" promised Janet.</p>

<p>"We want him to get well so he can be in
the circus," added Teddy.</p>

<p>"Oh, I guess he'll be all right for that,"
said the doctor, with a laugh as he hurried
away to look after a sick horse.</p>

<p>A soft bed was made for Skyrocket in the
barn, and a basin of fresh water was placed
near him. He licked Teddy's hands in gratitude
as the little boy patted him in coming
away.</p>

<p>It was several days after the adventure
with Skyrocket and the trap that something<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
else exciting happened at the home of the
Curlytops.</p>

<p>Mr. Nip, the red, green and yellow parrot,
became ill. His feathers were ruffled up, he
sat all in a lump on his perch, and he would
not eat.</p>

<p>"I guess you'd better have the man from
the bird store come up to see your parrot,"
said Mr. Martin, when he went out to the
barn at the children's request to look at Mr.
Nip. "Your mother will call the bird man
on the telephone."</p>

<p>And when the bird man&mdash;that is to say
the man who kept the bird and fish store&mdash;came
to see Mr. Nip, he said the parrot
should be kept in the kitchen and fed special
food with a little medicine in it for a few
days.</p>

<p>So that is how it happened that Mr. Nip
was moved in from the barn to the house.
And it was the third night that the parrot
had slept in the house that something happened.</p>

<p>In the middle of the night the Curlytops
were awakened by hearing Mr. Nip cry out
loudly:</p>

<p>"Go 'way! Go 'way! I'm a crack-crack-cracker!
Get out of here!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span></p>

<p>Teddy and Janet, who seemed to be the
only ones awakened by this alarm of Mr.
Nip, listened, half shivering in their beds.</p>

<p>"Did you hear that?" called Teddy to his
sister in the next room.</p>

<p>"Yes. What is it?" inquired Janet.</p>

<p>"It's Mr. Nip," whispered back the Curlytop
boy. "He's calling to someone. Maybe
daddy or mother's down there giving him
medicine."</p>

<p>But just then the parrot set up such a
screeching as the children had never heard,
since he came from Uncle Toby's at least.</p>

<p>"Go 'way! Go 'way!" cried the bird.
"I'm a crack-crack-cracker! Police! Fire!
Burglars!"</p>

<p>And then, to the surprise and terror of
the Curlytops, a strange voice, somewhere
downstairs in their house, exclaimed in a
harsh whisper:</p>

<p>"Do something to that parrot! Throw a
rug over his cage, or he'll have the whole
house awake. Make him be quiet!"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span></p>
<h5>THE HAND-ORGAN MAN</h5>

<p>The Curlytops cuddled down in their
beds. Janet said afterward that she pulled
the clothes over her ears. Teddy did the
same at first, and then he began to think.
And his first thought was that someone besides
those who had a right to be there, were
in his mother's kitchen. And of course the
next thought that came to Teddy was:</p>

<p>"Burglars!"</p>

<p>Somehow or other he happened to hit on
just exactly the very thing that was happening
downstairs.</p>

<p>"Jan! Janet!" hoarsely whispered
Teddy, thrusting his head out from under
the sheet he had pulled over himself.</p>

<p>But Janet did not answer.</p>

<p>From down in the kitchen, however, the
little Curlytop boy could plainly hear the
parrot saying:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span></p>

<p>"I'm a crack-crack-cracker!"</p>

<p>"I'll hit him a crack if he doesn't keep
quiet!" said a harsh voice. "Do you hear
anyone coming, Bill?"</p>

<p>"No," replied another voice, which, Teddy
thought, must belong to the man called Bill.</p>

<p>"They're burglars trying to get our parrot!"
quickly thought Teddy. "I'm not going
to let them have Mr. Nip. If they take
him away he can't be in our circus. Course
he can't do tricks like Skyrocket and Top,
but he's nice to look at. The burglars shan't
get Mr. Nip!"</p>

<p>Teddy slipped out of bed and went, as
softly as he could, to the room where his
father and mother slept. They were sound
in slumber, which is the reason neither of
them heard the parrot talking and screeching.
Besides, the rooms of Teddy and Janet
were nearer the kitchen.</p>

<p>"Daddy! Mother! Wake up!" whispered
Teddy.</p>

<p>The sound of his parents' heavy breathing
was the only answer the little boy received.</p>

<p>"Daddy! Mother!" he called again.
"Wake up! There's a burglar downstairs,
and he's trying to take Mr. Nip!"</p>

<p>There was silence for a moment, and then<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>
Teddy reached over and gently pulled his
mother by her hand, which was hanging
down outside the bed.</p>

<p>"What is it? What's the matter?" suddenly
asked Mrs. Martin. In another instant
she had pulled the cord attached to an
electric light over her bed, and the room was
bright in a moment. Then Mr. Martin awakened,
and both parents looked at the little
Curlytop boy.</p>

<p>"What's the matter, Ted? Walking in
your sleep?" asked his father. For sometimes
Teddy did do that.</p>

<p>In answer the little fellow put his finger
to his lips to make his father and mother
understand that he wanted them to keep
quiet.</p>

<p>"It's burglars&mdash;two of 'em!" whispered
Teddy. "One is named Bill, but I don't
know the other one's name. They've come
to get Mr. Nip."</p>

<p>"What's that&mdash;our parrot? Nonsense!"
exclaimed Mr. Martin. "You have been
dreaming, Teddy, my boy. Go back to bed."</p>

<p>But just then, from down in the kitchen,
came the voice of the parrot shrieking:</p>

<p>"I'm a crack-crack-cracker! Police, Fire!
Burglars!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span></p>

<p>Then came a banging, clashing sound, and
a man's voice cried:</p>

<p>"There! See if that will keep you quiet!"</p>

<p>An instant later there was a sound as if
the parrot's cage had been knocked over, or
had tumbled over, and Mr. Nip cried:</p>

<p>"Help! Help! Help!"</p>

<p>Out of bed jumped Mr. Martin, going toward
the closet where he kept his revolver.</p>

<p>"It is burglars!" he whispered.</p>

<p>"Oh, you mustn't go down! They might
shoot you! Go to the window and call the
police!" begged Mrs. Martin, clinging to her
husband.</p>

<p>Mr. Martin did both. He went to the window
and fired a shot from his revolver up
into the air. My! what a loud noise it made,
and it set Skyrocket and Top to barking out
in the barn. Perhaps the monkey chattered
also, but he could not be heard. However,
Mr. Nip's shrill shrieking seemed to resound
all over the neighborhood.</p>

<p>There was a moon, and as he looked from
his bedroom window Mr. Martin, by its light,
saw two men running out of the side gate.</p>

<p>"There go the burglars!" he cried, and
again he fired a shot. This made the strange<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>
men run all the faster, and by this time
Trouble had awakened and was crying.</p>

<p>"Janet, you come in and stay with
Trouble," called Mrs. Martin "I'll get
dressed, and then, when the police come, we
must see what the burglars have taken! Oh,
what a dreadful night! I hope they haven't
stolen much!"</p>

<p>"And I hope they didn't take Mr. Nip,"
echoed Teddy.</p>

<p>"I don't believe they carried away much
of anything," Mr. Martin remarked, as he
slipped on his bath robe. "I didn't see them
carry much as they ran."</p>

<p>By this time Janet had gone in to Trouble,
comforting him, stopping his frightened
sobs, and telling him a little story. And then
several neighbors, roused by Mr. Martin's
shooting, came in, and a little later the police
arrived.</p>

<p>An examination was made in the kitchen,
and it was found that the burglars had
broken open a window and had thus come
into the house. But no sooner had they entered
than Mr. Nip roused up and began to
talk. And it was his talk and his loud voice
that had awakened Janet and Teddy.</p>

<p>The burglars, fearing the parrot would<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>
awaken someone, had tried to silence him
by throwing something over the cage. But
the bird, who was always more excited when
strangers were around, kept on screeching
and yelling. Then one of the burglars, in
his anger, must have thrown something at
the parrot's cage, knocking it over, and this
was one of the crashes heard upstairs.</p>

<p>"Poor Mr. Nip!" said Teddy, when he was
allowed to come down with his father and
mother. The parrot's cage was set upright
again, no damage having been done.</p>

<p>The excitement seemed to have made Mr.
Nip feel better, for he showed no signs of
illness as he cried again and again:</p>

<p>"Police! Fire! Burglars! I'm a crack-crack-cracker!"</p>

<p>"You're a good polly!" declared Mrs.
Martin. "You saved our house from being
robbed!"</p>

<p>And there is no question but what Mr.
Nip had done that. Bringing the sick parrot
into the kitchen had been the means of
scaring away the burglars. No thieves will
stay in a house at night if they hear someone
moving around, or hear voices, and these bad
men may have thought at first that Mr. Nip
was some real person, calling for the police.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span></p>

<p>At any rate the burglars ran away, not
getting anything that they came to steal.
And it was all due to Mr. Nip.</p>

<p>"He'll sure be in our circus now," said
Teddy, as he made ready to go back to bed
again, the neighbors and police having left.
"Everybody will want to see a parrot that
drove away two burglars, won't they,
Daddy?"</p>

<p>"They probably will, Teddy boy," his
father replied. "Well, one of Uncle Toby's
pets has more than paid for his board bill
by to-night's work."</p>

<p>"Aren't you glad we got 'em?" asked
Teddy.</p>

<p>"Yes, I guess I am," his father answered,
laughing.</p>

<p>"Say! I wish I'd been over to your house
last night," exclaimed Jimmy Norton to
Teddy, when the story of the attempt to rob
was being talked over among the children.</p>

<p>"Well, I was wishing I was somewhere
else," said Janet. "Oh, but I was scared!"</p>

<p>"I was at first, but I knew I had to tell
my mother or my father," remarked Teddy.
"So I got out of bed."</p>

<p>"Teddy was brave," declared Janet.</p>

<p>"Oh, that wasn't anything," the little Curlytop<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>
boy said modestly. "I wasn't as brave
as Mr. Nip. He called the burglars names!"</p>

<p>"Everybody will be glad to come to the
circus to see him," said Harry Kent, who
was going to help with the show.</p>

<p>"We'll put Mr. Nip in a special cage, and
put a sign on so people will know he's the
parrot that scared the burglars," suggested
fat Jackie Turton.</p>

<p>In fact, Mr. Nip became quite celebrated.
For there was an account in the newspaper
of the attempted burglary at the Martin
house, and the part the parrot had played
was well told, so that all over Cresco Mr.
Nip was talked about.</p>

<p>"It's a good advertisement for our circus,
isn't it, Daddy?" asked Teddy, for the
paper mentioned that the Curlytops had a
number of pets they were getting ready to
place on exhibition in a show.</p>

<p>"Yes," said Mr. Martin, "it is."</p>

<p>"What are you going to do with the money
you get from your circus&mdash;if you get any?"
asked Mrs. Martin of the Curlytops one day
about a week after the burglars had gotten
in. By this time Mr. Nip was quite well
again, and could go back to the barn to be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>
with the monkey, the alligator and the white
mice and the rats.</p>

<p>"Oh, we'll get <i>some</i> money," declared
Teddy. "But I don't know what we'll do
with it. Maybe we'll buy more pets."</p>

<p>"Oh, I hope not!" laughed his mother.
"You have enough now."</p>

<p>As the days passed the Curlytops and their
friends worked with Uncle Toby's animals,
teaching them several new tricks. More
than once Teddy and Janet wished they had
Tip, the missing dog, as he had performed
so well with Top. But no word had come
about him, and it was felt he was gone forever.</p>

<p>"Skyrocket is good," Teddy told his boy
chums, "but he isn't as good a trick dog as
Tip and Top were when they did their tricks
together."</p>

<p>"Maybe we can teach Jack, the monkey,
some new tricks," suggested Harry Kent.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, Jack must learn a lot of tricks,"
agreed Teddy. "We'll start on him now, I
guess, as about the only tricks Snuff can do
are to roll around on the football and jump
through a paper hoop."</p>

<p>That last trick was a new one, and really
had not been intended for Snuff. One day<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
Teddy and Janet were getting some paper-covered
hoops ready for Skyrocket or Top to
jump through, as the dogs seemed to like
that trick. Snuff and Turnover were playing
together near by, and when Turnover
chased Snuff, the Persian cat leaped right
through a paper hoop.</p>

<p>"Oh, if we could only make him do that
for the circus!" Janet cried. "It would be
great!"</p>

<p>"We'll try," Teddy had said. And, after
many trials, they did succeed in getting
Snuff to leap through a paper hoop. It was
a fine trick.</p>

<p>But now the Curlytops planned to teach
Jack, their monkey, some tricks in addition
to a few that he had learned from Uncle
Toby or the sailor. So Jack was brought out
from his cage and given a banana, fruit of
which he was very fond.</p>

<p>"What trick shall we teach him?" asked
Janet.</p>

<p>"I think a jumping trick would be good,"
Teddy answered. "I'll go and get some
boxes, and we'll make a high thing, like a
tower, of them. We'll get Jack up on top,
and have him jump down. That will be
great, won't it?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span></p>

<p>"Fine," agreed Janet. "I'll help you get
the boxes."</p>

<p>The Curlytops left their monkey sitting
on a bench in the yard while they went back
into the barn after the boxes. Jack was
peacefully eating his banana when Teddy
and Janet left him. But when the children
came out with the boxes, it having taken
longer to find them than they had thought,
Jack was not to be seen.</p>

<p>"Oh, Jack is gone!" cried Janet, looking
around.</p>

<p>"Maybe he's up in a tree," suggested
Teddy. "Here, Jack! Jack!" he called.</p>

<p>But there was no chattering answer, and
the monkey was not to be found. He had
not gone back into the barn, where the other
pets were, and Trouble, who was playing in
the back yard, said Jack had not passed him.</p>

<p>"Where can he be?" asked Janet. She
and Teddy were beginning to worry, when
Mrs. Johnson, into whose baby carriage
Slider had once been put by Baby William,
called from across the street:</p>

<p>"Are you looking for your dog, children?"</p>

<p>"No'm. For our monkey," answered
Teddy.</p>

<p>"Oh, maybe the hand-organ man has<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>
him," said Mrs. Johnson. "I saw an Italian
with an organ go into your yard a little
while ago."</p>

<p>"Did he have a monkey with him?" asked
Teddy.</p>

<p>"I don't much believe that he did. I saw
the man go in, but I didn't notice a monkey.
But I remember now that when the organ
man came out, he had a monkey with him.
Maybe it was yours."</p>

<p>"I'm sure it was!" cried Janet. "Oh,
Ted! The hand-organ man has taken Jack!
He took Jack when we were in the barn!"</p>

<p>"I didn't hear any hand-organ music,"
Teddy said.</p>

<p>"Course he wouldn't play when he came
to get Jack!" exclaimed Jan, with tears in
her eyes. "Oh, Ted, go for the police! The
hand-organ man has taken our monkey! Oh
dear!"</p>

<h5>TURNOVER AND SKYROCKET</h5>

<p>Perhaps it would have been better for the
Curlytops to have run into the house and
have told their mother about the missing
monkey. But neither Janet nor Teddy
thought of this, because they were so excited
over the news that Mrs. Johnson gave them&mdash;the
news that Jack had been taken away
by a hand-organ man.</p>

<p>"We've got to get him back!" cried Teddy.</p>

<p>"Of course!" agreed Janet. "It won't be
half a circus without a monkey in it."</p>

<p>"Come on!" called Ted, and out of the
yard he ran, followed by Janet. The Curlytops
took one look to make sure that Trouble
was safe before going away and leaving him.
The little fellow was playing with Turnover
and Skyrocket. He would do that for a long
time.</p>

<p>Out of the yard and down the street ran<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>
the little boy and girl, thinking only of getting
their monkey back.</p>

<p>"Did he go this way?" Teddy called to
Mrs. Johnson, who was watching him and
his sister.</p>

<p>"Yes, right down that street," answered
the mother of Baby Ruth. "But you had
better not chase after him. He might not
give Jack back to you, and he might be cross,
and maybe it wasn't your monkey he had at
all, Curlytops!"</p>

<p>But Teddy and Janet did not stay to hear
all this. They hurried on, Teddy a little
ahead of his sister, because, being a boy and
a year older, he could go faster. But every
now and then he stopped to wait for her.
They turned the corner of a street, and
Teddy, being in the lead, had the first glimpse
down it.</p>

<p>"Do you see him?" gasped Janet, hurrying
up to the side of her brother.</p>

<p>"No, he isn't here," was the answer.</p>

<p>Mr. Anderson, who left groceries at the
home of the Curlytops, came along just then
in the delivery wagon.</p>

<p>"Whoa!" he called to his horse. And
then, seeing that Teddy and Janet were worried
about something, he asked them: "Have<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>
you lost your little brother?" Mr. Anderson
knew how often Trouble ran away.</p>

<p>"No, sir," answered Teddy. "We're looking
for our monkey."</p>

<p>"And the hand-organ man," added Janet.</p>

<p>"Monkey? Hand-organ man?" exclaimed
Mr. Anderson. "Are you going to give a
party, and do you want the hand-organ man
to play at it, and the monkey to do tricks?"</p>

<p>"Oh, no, this is our own pet monkey," exclaimed
Janet.</p>

<p>"The hand-organ man took him away
when he was eating a banana," added Teddy.</p>

<p>"Our monkey&mdash;his name is Jack&mdash;he was
eating the banana&mdash;not the hand-organ
man," said Jan, fearing Mr. Anderson might
not understand what her brother meant.</p>

<p>"And he does tricks, and we're going to
have him in our little circus&mdash;I mean our
monkey does tricks," went on Teddy.</p>

<p>"Well, I guess I'll get the straight of it
after a while," said Mr. Anderson, with a
little laugh. "Anyhow it seems that some
stray hand-organ man has taken your monkey,
has he?"</p>

<p>"Yes. And we want our monkey back!"
cried Janet.</p>

<p>"Then you'd better get up here in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>
wagon with me," went on the grocery man,
"and I'll drive you down the street. It will
be quicker than walking, and, as I've delivered
all the orders, I'm in no hurry to get
back to the store. Hop up, Curlytops!"</p>

<p>He helped Janet and Teddy to the seat beside
him, and drove off. It was not the first
time the children had ridden with Mr. Anderson,
for he often took them with him when
he had occasion to stop at their house.</p>

<p>"Do you know which street he went
down?" asked the grocery man, as he called
to his brown horse which started off again.</p>

<p>"We don't know," answered Teddy. "We
didn't see him. We were in the barn, getting
some boxes so Jack&mdash;that's the monkey&mdash;could
do some tricks. We left him eating
a banana, and when we came out he was
gone. But Mrs. Johnson said she saw a
hand-organ man come out of our yard and
he had a monkey."</p>

<p>"And it must 'a' been Jack!" added Janet.</p>

<p>"Well, we'll try to get him back for you,"
promised Mr. Anderson, as he guided the
horse down the street. "And we'll ask some
of the people we meet if they have seen
Jack."</p>

<p>"Oh, now I know we'll get him back!" exclaimed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>
Janet, and there was a smile on her
face where, before, there had been a sad
look, which always came just before she
cried. "I'm glad we met you, Mr. Anderson,"
she said.</p>

<p>"So am I," agreed Teddy.</p>

<p>The first person they met was Patrick, the
man who worked for Mrs. Blake, the lady
into whose house Jack made his way one
night, making Mrs. Blake think he was a
fuzzy burglar.</p>

<p>"Oh, Patrick!" cried Teddy, "a hand-organ
man took our monkey away. Have
you seen him?"</p>

<p>"Which? The hand-organ man or the
monkey?" asked Mrs. Blake's gardener.</p>

<p>"Either one," said Janet. "He's the same
monkey that was once in your house, you
know."</p>

<p>"Yes," returned Patrick, with a smile, "I
know. Well, I'm sorry, but I didn't see
either the hand-organ man or the monkey."</p>

<p>"Giddap!" called Mr. Anderson to his
horse. "We must try someone else."</p>

<p>They drove along a little farther, and next
they met Sam White, a colored man, who
cut grass and did other work for the neighbors
of the Curlytops.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, Sam! have you seen our monkey,
Jack?" called Teddy.</p>

<p>"Seen a monkey? No'm, I hasn't," answered
the colored man, who had been wheeling
a lawn-mower.</p>

<p>"Did you see a hand-organ man?" asked
Janet.</p>

<p>"Yes'm, I done seen a hand-organ man,"
was the answer. "He's jest 'round de corner
ob de next street. But I didn't see him hab
no monkey."</p>

<p>"Maybe he has our monkey hidden inside
the hand-organ so no one will see Jack!"
cried Teddy. "Please hurry, Mr. Anderson!"</p>

<p>"I will," promised the grocery man.
"Giddap there, Molasses!" he called to his
horse. "We're in a hurry!"</p>

<p>And as they turned the corner of the street,
toward which Sam White had pointed, there
came to the ears of the Curlytops the strains
of hand-organ music.</p>

<p>"There he is! I see him!" cried Janet,
pointing. "He's stopped, and he's playing!"</p>

<p>"Yes, and I see our monkey, too!" added
Teddy. "Please hurry down there, Mr.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>
Anderson, and we'll take Jack away from
that bad hand-organ man."</p>

<p>"Maybe it isn't your monkey," said the
grocer. "All monkeys look alike to me. I
couldn't tell one from the other, but maybe
you can. Giddap, Molasses!" he called again
to his horse, and down the street clattered
the Curlytops.</p>

<p>They came to a stop in front of the organ
grinder just as the dark-colored Italian
ground out the last strains of a tune. And
there, surely enough, perched on the top of
the organ, was a monkey.</p>

<p>"Jack! Jack! Come here!" cried Teddy,
getting ready to jump down from his seat in
the wagon.</p>

<p>"Come away from that bad man!" added
Janet.</p>

<p>The organ grinder turned quickly, gave
one look at the Curlytops and at Mr. Anderson,
and then, slinging his organ up on his
back, started hurriedly up the street, taking
the monkey with him.</p>

<p>"Here! Hold on a minute!" called the
grocer, getting down off the seat, and then
helping Teddy and Janet down. "If you
have a monkey belonging to these children<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>
you must give it back, or I'll call a policeman!"</p>


<p>"No! No!" jabbered the Italian. "Dis
a-monk mine! Long time mine! No belong
childerns! Goo'-bye!"</p>

<p>He would have been off down the street
and around the corner in another few seconds,
but Teddy, rushing after him, looked
and made sure it really was Jack that the
organ player had with him. There was a
queer little tuft of white hair on the end of
Jack's tail, and this monkey had the same
mark.</p>

<p>"Jack! Jack!" cried Teddy. "Come on,
to me! I'll give you all the bananas you
want!"</p>

<p>"Dis-a my monk!" jabbered the Italian.</p>

<p>"He is not! He's ours!" declared Janet,
as she hurried up to the side of her brother.
"Make him give back our monkey that we
got from Uncle Toby!" she appealed to Mr.
Anderson.</p>

<p>"If he doesn't," said the grocer, "I'll call
a policeman and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>But just then Jack acted for himself.
With a shrill chatter he broke loose from
the string that was tied to the collar about
his neck. There had been no cord on him
when he was eating a banana in the yard of
the Curlytops, and the hand-organ man must
have tied it there after he took the children's
pet. Once free, Jack made one leap and
landed safe in Teddy's arms.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span></p>

<p>Now, Jack was rather a large monkey, and,
jumping from a distance, as Jack did, he
knocked Teddy over. Flat down on the sidewalk
sat Teddy, the monkey clinging with its
hairy arms about the little boy's neck.</p>

<p>"Oh! Oh!" exclaimed Janet, and then
she stopped, for she did not know what else
to say.</p>

<p>"Look out!" cried Mr. Anderson. "Maybe
that's a savage monkey, and he'll bite
you!"</p>

<p>"This is Jack all right," declared Teddy.
"I know him and he knows me. He didn't
hurt me. I&mdash;I just sat down, that's all,"
and the little Curlytop boy laughed.</p>

<p>Jack chattered, clung tighter to his master,
and then the crowd that had gathered
also laughed. For it looked so odd to see
Teddy sitting on the sidewalk, with a monkey,
quite a large one, clinging to his neck.</p>

<p>"What's the matter here? What's the
trouble?" asked a gruff but not unkindly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>
voice, and on the outside of the crowd appeared
Policeman Cassidy.</p>

<p>"Oh, Cassidy," said Mr. Anderson, "this
Italian took the Curlytops' monkey, and they
just got him back&mdash;I mean they got the monkey
back. The Italian&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>But with a half-smothered cry of anger,
the Italian started to run down the street,
his hand-organ swaying from side to side on
his back. He had no wish to meet Policeman
Cassidy and be arrested for having taken
Jack.</p>

<p>And that is just what the Italian had done.
He had sneaked into the yard and, seeing
the monkey unfastened and eating a banana,
had picked up the pet and hurried off with
him. The Italian must have known how to
talk to and handle monkeys, for Jack made
no outcry, but went peaceably with his captor.
Perhaps the monkey was afraid of being
beaten. And, so that Jack could not get
away, the Italian had tied a string to the
collar.</p>

<p>But, thanks to Mr. Anderson and the
grocery wagon, the Curlytops had gotten
back their pet. The Italian had not played
his organ very near the home of Teddy and
Janet for fear of their hearing it, I suppose.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>
But when he thought he was far enough
away he started, and Sam White had heard
him.</p>

<p>"Maybe the hand-organ man kept Jack
hidden under his coat until he got down
here," said Janet.</p>

<p>"Perhaps," agreed the grocer, as the
crowd began to melt away, seeing there was
to be no more excitement. "And now if you
Curlytops, and your monkey, will get into
the wagon, I'll drive you back home."</p>

<p>"Do you want me to chase after that Italian
and arrest him?" asked the policeman.</p>

<p>"No, thank you, I guess not," answered
Teddy, as he rubbed Jack's fuzzy head. "We
got our monkey back, and now we can start
to teach him some tricks for the circus.
We'll send you a free ticket to the show,
Mr. Anderson, 'cause you helped us get Jack
back."</p>

<p>Janet whispered something to her brother.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes," added the little fellow, "we'd
like to have you come, too, Mr. Policeman
Cassidy."</p>

<p>"I'll come and stand guard at the ticket
wagon," laughed the big, good-natured officer.
"And if I see that Italian sneaking
up I'll chase him."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span></p>

<p>"I guess he won't come," said Teddy.
Then he and his sister climbed up on the
seat beside Mr. Anderson and were driven
back to their home. It was time, too, for
their mother was out at the gate, holding
Trouble by the hand, and looking up and
down the street.</p>

<p>"Where have you been, Curlytops?" she
asked them. "And what are you doing in
Mr. Anderson's wagon&mdash;and with the monkey?
Did Jack run away?" she asked.</p>

<p>"He was taken away," explained Teddy.</p>

<p>"By an old organ grinder," added Janet.</p>

<p>And then the story was told.</p>

<p>"Dear me," said Mrs. Martin, when it was
finished. "I'm sure if your father and I had
known all the things that were going to happen
because of Uncle Toby's pets, we would
not have brought them home."</p>

<p>"Oh, it's fun!" laughed Teddy, slipping
down with Jack.</p>

<p>"And Policeman Cassidy is coming to our
circus," said Janet.</p>

<p>"Don't forget me!" called Mr. Anderson,
as he drove away with the wagon.</p>

<p>"We won't!" promised the Curlytops.</p>

<p>"You been take Jack to barber's?" asked<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>
Trouble, letting go his mother's hand to pat
the monkey.</p>

<p>"The barber's?" repeated Teddy, as he
put Jack down on a box and gave the pet a
banana, as had been promised. "What made
him think that?" Teddy asked his mother.</p>

<p>"He's been singing that Mother Goose
verse, 'Barber, barber! shave a pig. How
many hairs will make a wig? Four and
twenty, that's enough, give the barber a
pinch of snuff.' I suppose Trouble thought
maybe Snuff, the cat, had something to do
with a barber, and he got Jack mixed up in
it somehow. But I am glad you Curlytops
are home again. I was getting worried about
you. What are you going to do now?"</p>

<p>"Teach Jack to jump off a high tower of
boxes," explained Ted. "We were getting
ready to do that when the Italian took Jack.
Come on, Janet, we'll make the box tower."</p>

<p>"Me help!" cried Trouble.</p>

<p>"Oh, you'll be more bother than you will
help," replied Janet. "You'll be knocking
the tower over all the while, or trying to
climb up on it. You go and play with Skyrocket
and Turnover," she advised, as the
dog and cat came around the path.</p>

<p>"All wite! Me make Turn an' Sky do<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>
circus twicks!" said Trouble, talking half to
himself.</p>

<p>Having made sure that Jack was comfortable
and had not been harmed by the Italian
who took him away, the Curlytops set about
building, of old packing boxes, the tower off
which they hoped their monkey would leap,
thus doing a new trick for the pet circus.
Teddy and Janet were so busy they paid no
attention to Trouble, except to notice, now
and then, that he was playing at the end of
the yard with Skyrocket and Turnover, or
"Sky" and "Turn", as he shortened the
pets' names.</p>

<p>"There, I guess the tower is high enough
for the first few jumps," Teddy remarked,
as he nailed in place the last of the boxes.
"We don't want Jack to jump down from
too high a place at first."</p>

<p>"No," agreed Janet, "we don't. He might
hurt himself, or he might get scared, and
then he wouldn't want to be in the circus.
But we ought to have some sort of net for
him to jump into, didn't we ought, Teddy?"</p>

<p>"I guess we did," said the Curlytop boy.
"Then we can make the tower higher. Oh,
I know what we can have for a net!" he suddenly
cried.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span></p>

<p>"What?" asked Janet.</p>

<p>Her brother pointed to a clothesline in the
yard, across which were drying some lace
curtains that had just been washed.</p>

<p>"They'll be just dandy for a circus net!"
Teddy went on. "You can hold one end, and
I'll hold the other. But we won't make the
tower any higher for a while. I'll get a
curtain for a net."</p>

<p>"S'pose mother will mind?" asked Janet.</p>

<p>"Oh, no, I don't s'pose so," answered
Teddy. "It won't hurt the curtain. Jack
isn't so big that he'll tear it, and if it gets
dirty, an' maybe it will a little, we can wash
it again. You get Jack now, and I'll get
the curtain. Then we'll make Jack climb up
to the top of the box tower and jump off."</p>

<p>"How you going to get him to go up?"
asked Janet, when Ted came back with his
mother's lace curtain which he had taken off
the line.</p>

<p>"I'll put a piece of banana up there on the
top box," Teddy answered. The pile of
boxes, nailed together, was higher than his
head, but he had brought out the stepladder
so he could reach up with that.</p>

<p>"How you going to get Jack to jump down
into the lace curtain net?" Janet went on.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span></p>

<p>"I'll hold out another piece of banana,"
Teddy replied. "Come on here, Jack, and
learn a new trick!" he called to the monkey.</p>

<p>But just then both Teddy and Janet saw
a sight that made them cry out in surprise.
And the sight was that of Trouble, coming
around the corner of the barn, driving before
him Turnover and Skyrocket, the first
cat and dog pets the Curlytops had ever
owned. But Turnover and Skyrocket had
never looked so funny as they did now, with
Trouble urging them on and crying:</p>

<p>"I dot a new twick! I dot a new twick!
Look what me make Turn an' Sky do!"</p>

<h3><a name="CHAPTER_XV" id="CHAPTER_XV"></a>CHAPTER XV</h3>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span></p>
<h5>PLANNING THE CIRCUS</h5>

<p>"Well, look what that little tyke has
done!" cried Teddy, with a laugh.</p>

<p>"All by himself, too!" added Janet.
"How did he ever think of it?"</p>

<p>"And how he got Turnover and Skyrocket
to stand still long enough to be harnessed up
is a wonder!" said Teddy.</p>

<p>For that is what baby William had done.
With bits of string, straps and strips torn
from some pieces of cloth he had found in
the barn, he had made a crazy jumble of a
harness for the dog and the cat. They were
tied and fastened together.</p>

<p>But this was not all. Besides harnessing
the dog and cat together, like a team made
up of a big horse and a little pony, Trouble
had made the two pets fast to a small express
wagon that he claimed as his very own,
though it had once belonged to Teddy.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span></p>

<p>"And look what he has in the wagon!"
cried Janet, now laughing as heartily as was
Teddy. "My old rag doll&mdash;Miss Muffin!"</p>

<p>In her earlier days Janet had a large rag
doll, which had been named Miss Muffin, just
why no one knew. But as she grew older
and had other dolls, and finally had come to
play more with her brother and the pets than
with such toys, Janet had forgotten all about
Miss Muffin. So the rag doll had been tossed
here and there, sometimes in one corner and
sometimes in another, getting more ragged,
torn and dirty as the weeks went by.</p>

<p>But Baby William had found this old doll
and had tied it to the little seat in his express
wagon. And there sat Miss Muffin, one eye
partly scratched off her painted cloth face,
and the other eye, by some accident, skewed
around until it was standing up and down,
and did not lie sideways as most eyes do.</p>

<p>"I give Miss Muffin a wide," announced
Trouble. "She 'ike it, an' maybe it's a twick
for de circus!"</p>

<p>Teddy and Janet looked at one another
and then they both laughed.</p>

<p>"Say, it <i>would</i> be a good trick!" said
Teddy at length. "We could dress Trouble
up funny like, and have him come in driving<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>
Turnover and Skyrocket. The people would
clap like anything."</p>

<p>"I believe they would," agreed Janet.</p>

<p>"Did Turnover scratch you when you tied
all those strings on, Trouble?" she asked her
little brother.</p>

<p>"Nope! Turn, he 'ike it," declared Baby
William. "An' Sky, he puts hims tongue on
my hands and 'ick me."</p>

<p>"I guess he wouldn't have much trouble
with Skyrocket," said Teddy. "I've harnessed
the dog to little carts before. But I
never hitched the dog and cat together. You
made a fine trick there, Trouble."</p>

<p>"I be in circus?" asked the little fellow.</p>

<p>"Sure you may be in the circus," said
Janet. "It will be one of the best acts. And
we can tie ribbons on the necks of Sky and
Turn, as Trouble calls them, to make it look
prettier. Go on, Trouble," she said to her
little brother, "let's see you drive 'em around
the yard.  Maybe they'll break away, or get
all tangled up, and then it wouldn't be a
good act for our show," she said to Teddy.</p>

<p>But Trouble seemed to have charmed Skyrocket
and Turnover to do just what he
wanted them to do, and they walked slowly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>
around the paths in the yard, giving Miss
Muffin a fine ride.</p>

<p>"Don't keep 'em hitched up too long,
Trouble," advised Janet. "If you do they'll
get tired, and won't like it next time."</p>

<p>"I undwess 'em now," said the little boy.
By "undressing" he meant taking the string
and strap harness off the dog and cat.</p>

<p>Turnover and Skyrocket seemed very glad
to be set free, and they ran off together, while
Trouble stayed with his brother and sister,
as they had told him they were going to make
Jack do a trick now.</p>

<p>It was time to see if they could get the
monkey to do what was wanted of him. The
tower of boxes had been built, and Teddy
had two bananas, one to get Jack to climb up
on top of the pile, and another yellow fruit
to induce the monkey to leap down. The lace
curtain net had also been provided.</p>

<p>"Now, Jack, we'll see what good you are,"
said Teddy, as he climbed up on the stepladder
and placed the banana on the top-most
box, letting part of the fruit stick out
over the edge.</p>

<p>"Here, Jack!" called Teddy, standing half
way up the ladder. "Come on and do your
trick!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span></p>

<p>The monkey chattered a little, but came
to Teddy, who picked the fuzzy creature up
in his arms. Holding Jack up, Teddy
showed him the banana on top of the pile
of boxes.</p>

<p>With another chatter, Jack scrambled out
of Teddy's arms, and with the usual quickness
of monkeys, was soon on top of the pile
of boxes&mdash;the "tower" as Ted and Jan called
it. When they gave their circus they
planned to cover the pile of boxes with green
boughs and pretend it was a big tree in the
jungle.</p>

<p>"Oh, see!" cried Janet in delight, as she
saw Jack on top of the pile, eating the
banana he found there. "He's done the
first part of the trick all right, Teddy!"</p>

<p>"Yes, and if he does the last part as well
it will be fine!" declared the little Curlytop
boy. "But the last is the hardest part. Jack
may want to climb down instead of jumping.
But first we'll let him eat the banana, and
get hungry for the second one."</p>

<p>So the three children stood on the ground,
and watched Jack, up on the tower, eating
his banana. The monkey looked down, making
funny faces, which he seemed to be doing
most of the time, and Trouble laughed.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span></p>

<p>"He is funny!" laughed Janet. "I'm
sure the people who come to our circus will
like Jack."</p>

<p>"They'll like him a lot more if he does
tricks," said Teddy. "Come on, Jan," he
called, after a while. "We'll get the net
ready now. I guess it's time he jumped for
the other banana."</p>

<p>Mrs. Martin had not seen the Curlytops
take her lace curtain off the line to use for
a circus net. If she had, she would, of course,
have stopped them. But Teddy and Janet
did not think they were doing anything very
wrong. As for Trouble, he never bothered
his head about it. Whatever Ted or Janet
did was all right to him.</p>

<p>"If we each have to hold one end of the
curtain net, how are we going to hold out
the banana so Jack will see it?" asked Janet
of her older brother.</p>

<p>"We'll lay the banana in the middle of the
net," decided Ted.</p>

<p>This was done, and when the curtain was
held stretched as tightly as Janet and Teddy
could pull it, as they had once seen the Cresco
firemen stretch out a life-net in a practice
drill, the banana was placed in the center.</p>

<p>"Come on now, Jack! Jump down!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>
called Teddy. "Jump down and get your
other banana!"</p>

<p>Jack chattered, but did not jump. He
clung to the edge of the tower of boxes, made
two or three motions as if he were coming
down, but he did not descend.</p>

<p>"I guess he doesn't see the banana," remarked
Janet. "One of us ought to hold it
up."</p>

<p>"We can't, and hold the net too," Teddy
declared.  "And if we don't hold the net,
and Jack jumps, he may hurt himself, and
then he can't be in the show."</p>

<p>"Oh, I know what we can do!" Janet declared.</p>

<p>"What?" asked Teddy.</p>

<p>"We can have Trouble hold the banana!
Let him stand right near the outside edge
of the net, near the middle, and hold up the
banana. Then Jack will see it and jump."</p>

<p>"That is a good idea," remarked Teddy.
He was always willing to give his sister
credit for thinking of things to do. "Come
on, Trouble," called Teddy to his brother.
"Hold the banana up for Jack!"</p>

<p>"Eess, me do dat!" replied Baby William,
so excited he could hardly talk at all, much
less talk properly.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span></p>

<p>Eager to do his share in getting ready for
the circus, Trouble held the banana up as
high as he could reach, so that Jack could
see it. And this time the monkey caught
sight of the fruit.</p>

<p>With a chatter of delight at the good
things he was getting to eat, Jack came down,
but not exactly in the way Janet and Teddy
wanted him to. For the pet <i>climbed</i> down
the boxes, which were of different sizes, making
many places where he could hold on by
his hands and tail. He didn't jump at all!</p>

<p>With a chatter and a scramble, Jack
reached the ground, ran around the net to
where Trouble stood, and then just reached
up, plucked the fruit from the little chap's
hand and began to eat it. And it was all
done so quickly that Ted and Janet hardly
had time to say a word.</p>

<p>Finally, however, after laughing at the
funny look on Trouble's face when he saw
the monkey snatch away the banana, Teddy
said:</p>

<p>"Oh, Jack! I didn't mean for you to
come down that way! I wanted you to jump
into the net! Here, you can't have the rest
of that banana until you jump for it."</p>

<p>Teddy took the fruit away from his fuzzy<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>
pet, and Jack jabbered and chattered at the
top of his voice, for he did not like this at
all. To have a banana taken away when he
was just half finished with it! That didn't
seem fair!</p>

<p>"Come on! We'll try again, Jan," said
Teddy, holding the half-eaten yellow fruit
out of Jack's reach. For the monkey was
jumping up trying to get back the banana.</p>

<p>"You'll have to get him up on top of the
boxes again," Janet said.</p>

<p>"Yes, and I guess I'll have to break off a
piece of this banana to get him to go up after
it," her brother said. "Come on, Jack!" he
cried.</p>

<p>Breaking what was left of the banana in
half, Teddy once more climbed the step ladder
and put the pulpy mass on top of the
pile of boxes. Jack saw what was done, and
in an instant he had climbed up.</p>

<p>"He's learning to go up fine!" declared
Teddy, as he got down and moved the ladder
away, so Jack would not use that in his
descent. "If we can only make him jump
now. Get ready, Trouble, to hold up the
banana again."</p>

<p>"There isn't much left of it," Janet remarked.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span></p>

<p>"It's all there is until we go to the store
for more," answered Teddy. "I guess it
will do. We'll wait until he swallows what
he's eating now, and then Trouble can hold
up what is left."</p>

<p>Anxiously the Curlytops and their little
brother watched Jack perched rather high
on the tower of boxes. The monkey made
short work of the small piece of banana that
had been put on his high perch. Then he
looked down for more.</p>

<p>"Hold it up, Trouble! Hold it up!" cried
Teddy, at one end of the curtain net, while
Janet held the other end.</p>

<p>"I hold it, but my hoots is gettin' tired,"
said the little fellow.</p>

<p>"Never mind, dear," consoled Janet. "If
Jack doesn't jump this time we'll let you
go. We can put a stick in the ground near
the edge of the net, and tie the banana to
that if Trouble is tired," she said to Teddy.</p>

<p>"Yes, but it won't be so good as Trouble,
'cause Jack likes him," Teddy answered.
"Look out! I think he's going to jump!"</p>

<p>And that is just what Jack did!</p>

<p>With a chatter of delight as he saw
Trouble holding up the piece of fruit, Jack<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>
stood for a moment on the edge of the pile
of boxes, and then he leaped.</p>

<p>Straight down he jumped toward the lace
curtain and toward Trouble, who held up
the banana. But before the monkey landed
there was a scream from the house, and Mrs.
Martin came running out.</p>

<p>"Don't let Jack jump into my lace curtain!
Don't do it, Curlytops!" exclaimed
their mother. "He'll tear it to pieces. Stop
him!"</p>

<p>But it was too late. Jack had jumped!</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h3><a name="CHAPTER_XVI" id="CHAPTER_XVI"></a>CHAPTER XVI</h3>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span></p>
<h5>TOP IS GONE</h5>

<p>Mrs. Martin ran as fast as she could from
the back door of the house to that part of
the yard where the Curlytops and Trouble
were planning and practicing the new circus
trick. Ted and Janet heard their mother's
cry, and, for the first time, realized that perhaps
they had done wrong in taking the lace
curtain for a net.</p>

<p>And by the time Mrs. Martin reached the
place where Trouble was standing, Jack had
jumped into the curtain. Right into the
middle of it he landed, and you can guess
what happened.</p>

<p>Yes, Jack tore through, making a big hole
in the lace. For it was not strong enough
for even a play circus net, and, really, Ted
and Janet should have known this.</p>

<p>Down through the hole in the curtain fell
Jack, but he did not go quite all the way<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span>
through. That is parts of the torn lace clung
to him.</p>

<p>In another instant, after landing lightly
on the ground, Jack sprang up, grabbed the
banana away from Trouble, and then made
a flying leap for the nearest tree, trailing
the lace curtain after him, dragging it on
the ground, catching it on the branches of
the tree and tearing it worse than ever.</p>

<p>So suddenly did Jack snatch the piece of
banana away from Baby William that the
little fellow was knocked down, just as Jack,
leaping away from the Italian hand-organ
man, had knocked Teddy to the sidewalk.</p>

<p>"Oh! Oh!" wailed Trouble, and then he
began to cry.</p>

<p>"Oh, Curlytops! Curlytops! What have
you done?" exclaimed Mrs. Martin in dismay.</p>

<p>Teddy and Janet could not say a word.
They seemed frightened and dazed when
Jack, in his wild leap, pulled the curtain
from their grasp.</p>

<p>"We&mdash;we&mdash;&mdash;" began Janet.</p>

<p>"Didn't mean to," finished Teddy.</p>

<p>And then Jack began to chatter as he tried
to tear loose the lace curtain which was
tangled all about him as he sat perched in a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>
tree, licking from his paws some bits of
crushed banana.</p>

<p>With the crying of Trouble, the chatter of
the monkey, and Mrs. Martin saying: "Oh
dear! Oh dear!" again and again, there was
quite a little excitement in the yard of the
Curlytops just then.</p>

<p>"Poor Trouble!" sighed Janet, as she
walked over to her little brother, who was
crying and sitting on the ground where Jack
had knocked him. "Did the monkey scratch
you?"</p>

<p>But Trouble was sobbing too hard to answer.</p>

<p>"What in the world were you doing?"
asked Mrs. Martin, as she picked Trouble up
in her arms, and finally made him stop crying.
"Why did you take one of my nice curtains?"</p>

<p>"We didn't know it was nice," Teddy answered.
"And we had to get something for
a net to have Jack jump in. I thought it
was an old curtain."</p>

<p>"It wasn't one of my best ones," said his
mother, "still I didn't want it torn. And it
is of no use now. Look! All in shreds!"</p>

<p>Indeed that was the state of the curtain.
For by this time Jack had managed to tear<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>
it off him, and it dangled in the tree like the
tail of a broken kite.</p>

<p>"It will be good for dolls' dresses," said
Janet. "And we can make other things to
dress the animals up in for the circus."</p>

<p>"Oh, you Curlytops!" cried Mrs. Martin,
trying not to laugh, for it was all rather funny
in spite of the fact that one of her curtains
was ruined. "However, it can't be
helped," she went on. "Only, next time,
come and ask me when you want a circus
net."</p>

<p>"We will," promised Teddy. "But, anyhow,
I guess we have taught Jack his new
trick. He jumped like anything, and from
the top of the tower, when he saw the
banana."</p>

<p>"Oh, doesn't he look funny now!" cried
Janet, pointing to the monkey, that was now
sitting on a box and looking at the children
and their mother. "He's got a lace frill on."</p>

<p>Part of the torn lace curtain was around
Jack's neck, making him, indeed, look as
though he wore a fancy collar.</p>

<p>"Him's got a bib on!" declared Trouble,
now over his fright and crying spell, the first
having caused the second. "Him's got a bib<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span>
on 'ike Trouble when him eats bread and
'ilk."</p>

<p>"So he has, dear!" laughed Mrs. Martin.
"And I guess Jack would rather be eating
bread and milk than doing tricks in this pet
show."</p>

<p>"Oh, no! He likes the circus! Or he will
when we get it started," declared Teddy.
"We've got lots to do yet, but I guess we
can have it in about two weeks. We'll get
Jack to practice his jump some more."</p>

<p>"Then we'll need more bananas&mdash;he ate
the last one," remarked Janet. "And Mr.
Nip likes them, too."</p>

<p>"We'll get more, but we won't make Jack
do any more tricks to-day, Jan," decided
Teddy. "Animals get cross if you keep 'em
at their tricks too long."</p>

<p>"And I think I'll take Trouble into the
house. He's had enough excitement for the
day," said Mrs. Martin. "Don't take any
more of my lace curtains," she added, as she
moved toward the house.</p>

<p>"We won't," promised the Curlytops.
Then they pulled from the tree, where Jack
had torn his way out of it, the remainder of
the lace curtain they had used for a landing
net for the pet monkey.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span></p>

<p>It was two or three days after this, during
which time the Curlytops had taught their
pets several new little tricks, that their
mother called Janet and Teddy to her one
afternoon. Mrs. Martin held a letter in her
hand, the postman having just left it for her.</p>

<p>"Here is something I want to talk to you
children about," said their mother.</p>

<p>"Oh, is that a letter from Uncle Toby, and
is he coming back to take his pets away before
we've had the show?" asked Janet.</p>

<p>"No, indeed," answered her mother, with
a laugh. "We haven't heard from Uncle
Toby since he left for South America. I
suppose, by this time, he is sitting in the
jungle, watching hundreds of parrots and
monkeys."</p>

<p>"I wish he'd send some more to us!" said
Teddy.</p>

<p>"Oh, gracious sakes! I don't!" laughed
Mrs. Martin. "I think we have quite enough
as it is."</p>

<p>But of course the Curlytops did not think
so.</p>

<p>"What I called you for," went on Mrs.
Martin, "was to ask if you really intend to
go on with this circus of yours. Do you
really intend holding it?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span></p>

<p>"Sure we do, Mother!" Teddy answered.
"We're going to have a tent, and seats and
everything."</p>

<p>"Are you going to charge money for persons
to come in?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Janet. "It's to be five cents
for big boys and girls, and three cents for
little ones like Trouble. Of course Trouble
won't have to pay, 'cause he's going to be
part of the show. But what is your letter
about, Mother?"</p>

<p>"It's about your circus," was the answer.
"At least now that I know you are really
going on with the performance this letter
will have something to do with it. This is a
note from some ladies who, like me, belong
to a charitable society," said Mrs. Martin.
"The secretary has just written me, asking
if I can not think up some plan to raise
money so some poor orphan children may be
sent to the country to board for a few weeks
this summer."</p>

<p>"Oh, can't we help the orphan children, as
we helped the crippled children once?"
asked Teddy.</p>

<p>"Just what I was going to say," went on
his mother. "You may take in quite a few
dollars giving your animal show, and I can<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span>
think of no better way of spending it than
to give it to the orphans. Besides, if it is
known that the circus is for charity, many
more people will come than would otherwise.
So do you Curlytops want to help the orphans?"</p>

<p>"Of course!" said Janet.</p>

<p>"Sure!" cried Teddy.</p>

<p>"Me help, too! What is it?"
asked Trouble, coming up just then.</p>

<p>"Oh, you're going to help all right!"
laughed Janet. "You're going to drive
Turnover and Skyrocket with my old rag
doll, Miss Muffin, in the express wagon, and
I'm sure you'll be so darling and funny that
everyone will laugh."</p>

<p>"And I hope Jack does his jumping
trick," said Teddy. "It would be great if
we had Tip and Top to perform together.
We could charge twenty-five cents for big
people to come in if we had the two trick
dogs."</p>

<p>"Well, one is better than none," said
Janet. "It's a good thing we have Top."</p>

<p>"Yes," agreed Teddy, "I suppose it is.
But I wonder where Tip can be?"</p>

<p>But of course no one could tell him that.</p>

<p>So it was settled that the money that was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span>
taken in for the show of the Curlytops and
their pets should go to the orphans, so they
might have a few weeks in the green country
during the hot summer.</p>

<p>The Curlytops were much excited that
evening, telling their father about the performance
for the orphans, and Mr. Martin
agreed that no better use could be made of
the money.</p>

<p>"You must take good care of your pets
from now until the time of the show," he
said. "Don't let them get away or become
ill, or you will not be able to give a good circus."</p>

<p>"Let's go out to the barn now, and see if
they are all right," proposed Janet.</p>

<p>"All right," agreed Teddy.</p>

<p>It was early evening, and light enough to
see in the barn. Top and Skyrocket barked
a welcome, Snuff and Turnover mewed their
delight at seeing the children, and while Mr.
Nip shrieked away about being a "crack-crack-cracker"
Jack chattered. About the
only quiet ones were the white rats and mice,
and Slider, the alligator.</p>

<p>"They're all right, and ready for the circus,"
said Teddy as he came out and locked
the door after him.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes, I can hardly wait!" murmured
Janet.</p>

<p>But in the morning there was bad news
for the Curlytops. Their mother, who had
gone out to the barn to open the door for
the animals, came hurrying back to the house
as Teddy and Janet descended for their
breakfast.</p>

<p>"Where is Top?" asked Mrs. Martin.</p>

<p>"Top!" exclaimed Teddy. "Why, isn't
he in the barn with Sky and the other pets?"</p>

<p>"No," answered his mother, shaking her
head. "Top is gone! The barn door was
locked, and all the other animals are there,
but Top is gone!"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span></p>
<h5>THE DOG SHOW</h5>

<p>Teddy and Janet looked at each other in
sorrow and dismay. It seemed that the
worst had happened&mdash;Top missing just when
they were getting ready for the show! First
Tip was gone, and now Top! Could it be
true?</p>

<p>"Are you sure, Mother?" asked Teddy.
"Maybe Top is hiding behind a box or something."</p>

<p>"Let's go look!" proposed Janet.</p>

<p>"Oh, I'm sure he isn't there," said Mrs.
Martin. "I called him, as I always do, when
I go to let him and Skyrocket out. But Top
did not come."</p>

<p>"Did Skyrocket?" asked Janet.</p>

<p>"Yes, he came rushing out of his kennel,
barking and wagging his tail as if he would
wag it off. And Snuff came out, and so did
Turnover. But there was no Top."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span></p>

<p>Teddy started for the barn on the run, and
so did Janet. Their mother followed more
slowly. She felt very sorry for her Curlytops,
as she knew they would be very sad
over the loss of their second pet dog.</p>

<p>"The barn door is locked!" said Teddy,
as he reached it and tried to go in.</p>

<p>"Yes, I locked it after me when I came
out," his mother said. "I wanted to make
sure that none of the other pets would get
away. But the door was locked when I first
went in this morning. It was locked just as
you left it last night."</p>

<p>"Then I don't see how Top could have
gotten out," Janet said.</p>

<p>"Unless there is some other place open
in the barn&mdash;like a window," Mrs. Martin
suggested.</p>

<p>"Let's look!" cried Teddy.</p>

<p>His mother turned the key in the padlock
on the outside of the barn door. As the door
opened and the Curlytops went in, they
were greeted by barks of welcome from Skyrocket,
by mews from Snuff and Turnover,
the cats, by chattering from Mr. Jack, the
monkey, and by shrill cries from Mr. Nip,
the parrot, who called as loudly as he could:</p>

<p>"I'm a crack-crack-cracker!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span></p>

<p>"They're all here but Top," said Mrs.
Martin. And as the Curlytops looked
around the barn they saw that this was so.
Top was not in sight.</p>

<p>"Here, Top! Top! Top!" called Teddy,
and he whistled. Mr. Nip also whistled, as
loudly and clearly as the little boy himself.
But there was no answer from his pet trick
dog.</p>

<p>Janet ran over and looked in the box where
Top always slept on a piece of carpet. The
box was empty.</p>

<p>"Where do you s'pose he can be?" she
asked her mother.</p>

<p>"That's what we must find out," was Mrs.
Martin's answer. "We must look all
through the barn. There are several places
where he may have gotten out&mdash;or been
taken out," she added a moment later.</p>

<p>It was Teddy who finally discovered the
open window by which it was thought someone
had entered the barn and taken Top out.
The window was near the stalls used by the
horses before Mr. Martin bought an automobile.
In a corner, at the left of the stalls
and too high from the floor of the barn for
Top to have reached, even in his best jump,
was a swinging window. This was open, as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>
Teddy found, and when his mother and
Janet came at his call, Mrs. Martin saw that
the bolt had been broken.</p>

<p>"That is how it happened," she said.
"Someone opened that window from the outside
last night, crawled in, and took Top
away. The dog himself could not have gotten
out of that high window. Someone must
have taken him."</p>

<p>"But wouldn't he bark and bite them?"
asked Janet.</p>

<p>"Top was too friendly to bite anyone unless
they harmed him," said her mother.
"And I have no doubt but that this man&mdash;it
must have been a man or a big boy&mdash;knew
how to be nice to Top. Maybe they gave him
a little piece of meat to chew on while they
took him away."</p>

<p>"Oh dear!" sighed Janet. "How shall we
ever get him back?"</p>

<p>"I'll call your father, and ask him what
to do," remarked Mrs. Martin. "This is
getting serious! Two of Uncle Toby's best
pets gone! If he comes back he will think
we did not take very good care of his animals."</p>

<p>"It wasn't our fault that a burglar came
and took Top," said Teddy.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span></p>

<p>"No, dear," answered his mother. "But
we must do what we can to get the dog back.
I'll call your father."</p>

<p>Mr. Martin came quickly when he heard
what had happened. He went to the barn
to look, and he agreed with his wife that,
during the night, someone had broken open
the barn window, had crawled in, and had
taken out Top.</p>

<p>"But why didn't they take Jack or Mr.
Nip or Slider?" asked Teddy. "All our
pets are nice. Why didn't they take more?"</p>

<p>"Maybe they didn't have time, or perhaps
they were frightened away, or they may have
wanted only Top," said Mr. Martin. "I
think that last is the real reason. A trick
poodle, like Top, is valuable. And if he could
be placed in a show with his chum Tip, the
two would earn a lot of money for whoever
had them."</p>

<p>"Then," said Teddy, "we've got to find
out who has Tip, and maybe then we'll get
back Top."</p>

<p>"Yes," agreed his father, "but it isn't going
to be easy. I'll report it to the police and
also to the police of that town where Tip
was taken."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span></p>

<p>"We can't have much of a show with Tip
and Top gone," said Janet sadly.</p>

<p>"Well, not so very," answered Teddy, trying
to make the best of it. "But if we don't
get Top back we still have some pets left.
The only thing is that Skyrocket has learned
to do some tricks with Top, and if Top
doesn't come back Sky can't do those tricks.
Oh dear, I wish I knew who had our two
trick poodles!"</p>

<p>"So do I!" chimed in Janet.</p>

<p>Mr. Martin called up the Cresco police and
told them of the theft. Word was also sent
to the town where the Curlytops had stopped
for lunch the day they had brought home
Uncle Toby's pets, when "Shorty" had been
left on guard.</p>

<p>After that there was nothing to do but
wait, though Ted and Jan wanted to go
around among their friends, asking if, by
chance, any of them had seen Top. And
after breakfast their mother allowed them to
do this.</p>

<p>To house after house of their friends and
neighbors went the two Curlytops, telling
the story of the theft of Top, and asking if
anyone had seen him. But it was a hopeless
search, as Mrs. Martin knew it would be.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span>
For whoever had taken Top, she felt sure,
would hide him away, and not let him be
seen in or about Cresco, where the pet animal
was well known.</p>

<p>"What's the matter, Curlytops?" asked
Policeman Cassidy, as he saw Teddy and
Janet going along the street one day, having
called at several houses, without getting any
word about Top. "What's the matter?
Can't you have the circus you were counting
on?"</p>

<p>"We can't have it as nice as we want it
with Top gone," answered Teddy, and then
he explained about the theft, of which the
policeman had not heard, having been away
on his vacation.</p>

<p>"We've been looking all over for Top,"
added Janet, when her brother had finished,
"but we can't find him."</p>

<p>"You aren't looking in the right places,"
said the policeman. "You won't find him at
the houses of any of your friends. If he was
there he'd run back to you as soon as he got
outside. Where you want to look is in some
dog show."</p>

<p>"Dog show?" exclaimed Teddy.</p>

<p>"Yes," went on Mr. Cassidy. "I've heard
about stolen dogs before. They are taken<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span>
by men who want to make money. And since
Top was a trick dog, as well as Tip, I'm sure
someone has them who would put them in a
show. So look for a dog show, and when you
find it go in and look at the dogs. That's
where you'll find Top, and maybe Tip, too.
It's in a dog show you should be looking!"</p>

<p>"Yes," agreed Teddy, after thinking the
matter over, "I guess we should. Thank
you, Mr. Cassidy. Come on, Jan, we'll look
for a dog show. Do you think there's one
in Cresco, Mr. Cassidy?"</p>

<p>"None that I've heard of," the officer answered.
"You'll see bill posters, and advertisements
on the fences when there's a dog
show around. Look for a dog show, and
maybe you'll find your pets."</p>

<p>The Curlytops thanked him again, and
walked off down the street together, filled
with a new idea. Eagerly they scanned the
walls and fences, seeking for some poster
that would tell of a show. And it was
not long before they saw just what they were
looking for.</p>

<p>"See!" cried Janet, pointing to a red and
black poster on a fence. "That tells of a
show, Ted."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes," agreed her brother, "so it does.
But it's over in Canfield."</p>

<p>The advertisement told of "Professor
Montelli's" wonderful collection of trained
and trick dogs. A show would be given
every afternoon and evening, the bill said,
and, as Teddy had remarked, it was over in
the neighboring town of Canfield.</p>

<p>"Maybe Tip would be there," suggested
Janet, as she and her brother looked at the
poster.</p>

<p>"And Top," added Ted.</p>

<p>"Let's go!" suddenly cried Janet. "I've
got most of my allowance that daddy gave
me. We can go on the trolley. It isn't far!"</p>

<p>Teddy thought it over for a moment.
Then he made up his mind.</p>

<p>"All right!" he said. "Let's go to the
dog show!"</p>

<h5>THE BLACK POODLES</h5>

<p>Once they were in the trolley, going to
Canfield, the two Curlytops felt quite happy.
They were happy for one reason, because
they were having a ride. Teddy and Janet
always liked to be doing things and going
somewhere, and this was one of those times.</p>

<p>And they were happy for another reason,
because they felt sure they would find Top,
and perhaps Tip. Who knew?</p>

<p>Policeman Cassidy had said the most
likely place to find the missing poodles would
be in a dog show. And they were going to
a dog show.</p>

<p>"Do you s'pose mother will mind?" asked
Janet of Ted, after they had ridden for a
little way in the trolley.</p>

<p>"Oh, I don't guess so," he answered.
"We'll soon be back, for it isn't very far to
Canfield, and she said we could go out and
hunt for Top."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span></p>

<p>"But maybe she didn't mean we were to
go so far, and on a trolley."</p>

<p>"She didn't tell us <i>not</i> to!" declared
Teddy.</p>

<p>"All right," went on Janet. "We're going,
anyhow."</p>

<p>"Whereabout in Canfield do you&mdash;you
Curlytops want to get out?" asked the trolley-car
conductor.</p>

<p>"Oh, do you know us?" asked Janet, for
the conductor had called the little boy and
girl by the name so often given them.</p>

<p>"Well, I don't exactly know you," he answered.
"But I would call you Curlytops if
you were my children. For the tops of your
heads are curly," he added with a laugh.</p>

<p>"Everybody calls us Curlytops," said
Teddy. "And could you please let us out
near the dog show?"</p>

<p>"The dog show," repeated the conductor,
wonderingly.</p>

<p>"This one," went on Ted, taking from his
pocket a hand bill of "Professor Montelli's
Wondrous Aggregation of Canine Cut-ups."
Teddy had found the bill in the street.</p>

<p>"Oh, that show!" exclaimed the conductor,
with a laugh. "Why, that's only a little side-show
in a tent near where this car runs. I'll<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span>
let you get off there if you want to, but it
isn't much of a show. It isn't a circus, you
know," he said, as he started the car again,
after a very fat lady had gotten off. "If
you're looking for a circus this isn't it. The
dog show is only a little side one&mdash;the kind
they used to charge ten cents to go in and
see after or before the regular circus. I hope
you Curlytops aren't running away to see a
circus," he added doubtfully.</p>

<p>"Oh, no, sir!" exclaimed Janet. "We're
looking for our lost dog, and we thought
maybe it was with this show. Two dogs we
had, Tip and Top," she went on. "They
were white poodles and they belonged to
Uncle Toby and they could do tricks. But
one was stolen when we were bringing them
home, and the other night Top was taken
from our barn. It's our dogs we're looking
for, not a circus."</p>

<p>"Besides, we're going to have a circus of
our own," added Teddy. "That is, we are
if we get Tip and Top back."</p>

<p>"Do you think your dogs ran off to join
a show?" the conductor asked.</p>

<p>"Oh, no!" answered Teddy. "They were
taken away. But Mr. Cassidy&mdash;he's a policeman&mdash;said
the right place to look for our<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span>
dogs was in a dog show, so we're looking."</p>

<p>"Well, this Professor Montelli, as he calls
himself, has a dog show near the end of my
trolley line," said the conductor. "I don't
know much about it, as it only came there
yesterday. It's in a little tent&mdash;a regular
side show. I'll put you off near it. But do
you think it will be safe for you to go there
alone and ask for your lost dogs?"</p>

<p>"Oh, we won't go right in and ask for
them," explained Teddy. He and his sister
had talked it over, and they had made up
their minds what they would do. "We'll
just go into the show&mdash;'cause we have money
to pay for our tickets," the Curlytop boy explained.
"Then if we see Tip and Top there
we'll take 'em right away."</p>

<p>"That's what we will!" declared Janet.
"And if that show man won't give our dogs
to us we'll call a policeman."</p>

<p>"Well, I guess you Curlytops can take
care of yourselves," laughed the conductor.
"You get off three blocks from here, and
then you'll be right near the dog show. Good
luck to you!"</p>

<p>"Thank you," replied Teddy and Janet.</p>

<p>They saw the tent&mdash;a small one with a
few flags on it&mdash;almost as soon as they<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span>
alighted from the trolley car. It was about
three o'clock, and a crowd about the tent
showed that the performance was going on,
or would soon start.</p>

<p>Professor Montelli's name was painted on
a strip of canvas over the entrance to the
tent, and on either side were painted pictures
of dogs doing all sorts of queer tricks. One
picture was that of a dog jumping off a high
platform into a tank of water.</p>

<p>"Oh, if we could only make our monkey
Jack do a trick like that!" whispered Janet
to Teddy.</p>

<p>"Maybe we can," he whispered back, as
they walked up to the tent. "But monkeys
don't like water, I guess. We might get
Skyrocket to do the jump. We'll try. But
now let's see if Tip or Top are here in this
show."</p>

<p>A man standing in a booth outside the tent
was calling out in a loud voice:</p>

<p>"Step right up, ladies and gentlemen!
Step right up, boys and girls! The big show
is about to begin!"</p>

<p>He ruffled a bundle of red tickets in his
hand and went on:</p>

<p>"Pay your dime and step right up. You'll
see the world-famed aggregation of canine<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span>
cut-ups! The funniest dogs you ever saw
doing the funniest tricks! There are hound
dogs, bulldogs, setter dogs, fox terriers, big
dogs, little dogs, all good dogs, and some
poodle dogs!"</p>

<p>Ted and Janet looked at each other.</p>

<p>"Poodles!" whispered the Curlytops.</p>

<p>Tip and Top were white poodles!</p>

<p>"Come on! Let's go in!" said Teddy
boldly.</p>

<p>He stepped up to the booth, bought two
tickets, and he and Janet went into the tent.
At one end was a raised platform, hung
about with red cloth. On the platform were
some chairs, a table, some pedestals, some
paper-covered hoops and other things used
in the dog tricks. There were also some
board benches, like circus seats, in the tent.</p>

<p>"Come on up front, where we can see the
dogs better," said Ted to his sister. "If we
see Tip or Top we'll call them right down
to us off the platform."</p>

<p>There were as yet not many persons in the
tent, and the Curlytops had no trouble getting
front seats. Then they anxiously waited
for the performance to begin, which it did in
a little while.</p>

<p>Out on the platform came a man with a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span>
very black moustache and a little whip. The
moustache was under his nose and the whip
in his hands. He looked around at the audience,
and then in a sing-song voice said:</p>

<p>"Ladies an' gen'men: With your kind
attention an' permission I will now show you
what my dogs can do. Let 'em on, Jack,"
he called to someone back of the platform.</p>

<p>A moment later about ten dogs rushed up
on the platform, barking and wagging their
tails. Every one of the dogs looked anxiously
at the black-eyed and black-moustached
man, as if afraid he would hit them
with the whip he carried. Each dog seemed
to know his or her place, and went to chair,
box, or platform, until all were arranged in
a half circle back of the man.</p>

<p>"First Lulu, the highest jumper in the
world, will perform some tricks," said Professor
Montelli. "Here, Lulu," he called,
and a long, thin greyhound leaped from a
chair and stood ready. This dog jumped
over a pile of high baskets, and through
some of them, there being no bottoms to
them. Then the greyhound leaped over a
high pile of chairs.</p>

<p>In turn the other dogs did tricks, some of
which the Curlytops had seen before, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span>
some of which were new. They quite enjoyed
the show, or they would have done so
had they not been worrying about getting
their own dogs back. They looked anxiously
at the dogs on the platform. None of them
was Tip or Top.</p>

<p>I shall not tell you all about the tricks the
dogs in this show did, for I want to tell you
about the circus the Curlytops had. Enough
to say that Professor Montelli seemed to
know a great deal about dogs, though I can
not say the trick animals loved him. They
seemed more afraid than anything else.</p>

<p>"Well, I guess we shan't find Tip or Top
here," said Ted to Janet after a while.
"There aren't any white poodles like ours."</p>

<p>"No, I guess not," sadly agreed the little
girl.</p>

<p>But just then Professor Montelli stepped
to the edge of the platform and said:</p>

<p>"This ends our regular performance,
ladies an' gen'men, but I have two more dogs
to show you. I have not finished training
them yet, an' they can do only a few tricks,
but I want you to be satisfied, an' think that
you got your money's worth, so you will
recommend my show to your friends. I will
now show you two more trick dogs. Bring<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span>
on the poodles, Jack," he called to his assistant.</p>

<p>Ted and Janet looked at each other,
quickly.</p>

<p>"Poodles!" they murmured, but they did
not speak out loud.</p>

<p>The same thought was in each of their
minds. If the poodles should be Tip and
Top!</p>

<p>A barking was heard back of the platform,
and, a moment later, on rushed two dogs,
exactly the same kind of poodles as were
Tip and Top, and exactly the same size.</p>

<p>But alas! Tip and Top were white, while
these poodles were jet black!</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span></p>
<h5>A HAPPY REUNION</h5>

<p>The hearts of the Curlytops had beaten
high with hope when they heard Professor
Montelli speak of some poodles. But when
they saw that the two dogs were black, instead
of white, their hearts sank.</p>

<p>"They look just like Tip and Top, but of
course they can't be," whispered Janet, as
the showman began clearing the stage platform
in readiness for the poodles to do some
tricks.</p>

<p>"No," answered Ted, in disappointed
tones, "Tip and Top were white&mdash;not black,
except for little spots. These dogs are black
all over. We might as well go home. Maybe
Policeman Cassidy knows of another dog
show."</p>

<p>"Oh, let's stay and see just one poodle
trick," begged Janet.</p>

<p>"All right," agreed Teddy.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span></p>

<p>So the Curlytops remained in their seats,
with the others of the audience. The two
black poodles barked, wagged their tails, and
looked at Professor Montelli.</p>

<p>"Come on now, King! Turn a somersault!"
suddenly cried the dark-moustached
man. Instantly one of the black poodles&mdash;the
one called "King," began turning somersault
after somersault. Right out to the end
of the platform he turned them, and then he
stood there, wagging his tail and waiting for
the applause, which he seemed to expect.</p>

<p>And the people did clap. They liked the
poodle's trick. Janet leaned over and whispered
to Teddy:</p>

<p>"That's just the same trick Tip did!"</p>

<p>"Yes," agreed the Curlytop boy. "But
it can't be Tip."</p>

<p>"No, I s'pose not," sighed Janet.</p>

<p>"Come back here, King," suddenly called
the trainer. "Now, Emperor," he went on,
pointing his whip at the other poodle. "It
is your turn. Walk on your hind legs!"</p>

<p>The other dog did not seem to understand.
It slunk away and growled a little.</p>

<p>"Here! None of that!" cried the trainer.
"You must do as I say! Walk on your hind
legs!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span></p>

<p>Still the dog would not mind.</p>

<p>"Emperor is not so good a dog as King,"
said the man, apologizing to the audience.
"I have not had him so long, and he does not
do his tricks very well. But I will make
him!"</p>

<p>Suddenly he flicked the dog he called "Emperor"
with the whip!</p>

<p>The dog let out a howl of pain.</p>

<p>"Here! Stop that!" cried Teddy, almost
before he knew what he was saying.</p>

<p>"Yes, don't hurt the dogs," added a lady,
looking kindly at the Curlytops. "The little
boy is right."</p>

<p>"I did not mean to hurt him," explained
Professor Montelli, smiling, but his smile
was not a kind one. He seemed to be a cruel
man, but he seemed to know that he must not
be cruel to his dogs in public. "Come, Emperor!"
he called more gently. "Walk on
your hind legs!"</p>

<p>This time the black poodle did so, walking
around the stage. Again Janet leaned over
and whispered to her brother:</p>

<p>"Top used to do that same trick!"</p>

<p>"Yes," agreed Teddy. "That's right."</p>

<p>And then a strange thing happened. All
at once the two poodles put their noses together,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span>
as though talking, which they may
have been doing in dog language. And then
the one the man had called Emperor suddenly
jumped on top of the back of the dog
called King, and King began walking around
the stage, giving the other a ride!</p>

<p>The people clapped at this trick, and the
two Curlytops grew strangely excited. Ted
and Janet looked at each other, standing up
in their seats.</p>

<p>"Ted, do you know what I think?" said
his sister. "I think those two dogs are
really Tip and Top&mdash;our poodles! That's
exactly the same trick they did in Uncle
Toby's house."</p>

<p>"But how could they be Tip and Top when
they're black, and Tip and Top were white?"
asked Teddy.</p>

<p>"I don't know," Janet answered. "But
I'm sure they are our dogs. Maybe they've
been in the coal bin and got all black. And,
oh, Ted! Look!"</p>

<p>Something else happening on the platform
of the dog show tent. The black poodle
called King began walking around in a little
circle in the middle of the stage. And, while
thus moving, the other poodle began to jump
over its companion's back. First this way<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span>
and then that one poodle jumped over the
other poodle's back.</p>

<p>"Why! Why!" cried Teddy. "That's
the other trick we saw them do, Janet!
That's the trick Mrs. Watson said Uncle
Toby taught them&mdash;I mean taught Tip and
Top."</p>

<p>"Yes," agreed Janet. "And I know these
dogs are our poodles&mdash;I don't care if they
are black!" Then, before Ted could stop
her, she called: "Here, Tip! Here, Top!
Come on!"</p>

<p>Instantly the two black poodles jumped
down off the stage, and with barks of joy,
and mad waggings of their little tails, ran
to the Curlytops.</p>

<p>"Oh, Top!" cried Janet, as she patted his
head, "I'm so glad we found you! I'd know
you anywhere, even if you are black!"</p>

<p>Both dogs knew the children, though of
course Top, having been with them longer,
knew them best. Tip had been taken away
soon after being removed from Uncle Toby's
house, but when Tip saw that Top was
friendly with the children, Tip was joyful
also.</p>

<p>I call the black dogs Tip and Top, for they
were really the missing poodles, and I will<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span>
explain how it was their color was changed.</p>

<p>No sooner did Ted and Janet call the black
poodles to them than Professor Montelli
grew very angry indeed. He jumped down
off the platform, and, going to where the
Curlytops stood at their seats, with the dogs
frisking around them, the trainer cried:</p>

<p>"Here! What do you mean by calling
my dogs away when I am making them do
tricks?  What do you children mean?"</p>

<p>"These aren't your dogs&mdash;they're <i>ours</i>!"
declared Ted.</p>

<p>"Yours! Nonsense!" blustered the
trainer. "These are my dogs. I have had
them a long while!"</p>

<p>"Not both of them!" said Janet, who remembered
what the man had said. "You
told us you hadn't had Emperor very long."</p>

<p>"Well, I have the other! They are both
my dogs!" cried the angry man. "If you
have lost any dogs you had better look somewhere
for them. Get out of my tent and
give me back the poodles!"</p>

<p>He made a move to thrust Ted and Janet
to one side and pick up the poodles, but a
man in the audience said:</p>

<p>"Not so fast, Professor. It seems to me
that by the way these dogs came to this girl<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span>
and boy when called that there may be something
in their claim. Did you lose two
dogs?" he asked Ted and Janet.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," they answered. And then Ted
told how Tip was taken out of their automobile
some weeks before, while Top was
stolen from their barn a night or two previous.</p>

<p>"Nonsense! As if I had their dogs!"
sneered the trainer. "What kind of poodles
did you lose, as you say?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Just exactly the same kind as these, and
they did the same tricks," Ted answered.
"We can make these do the same tricks you
did, and some more, too," he added.</p>

<p>"I don't believe it!" growled the trainer.</p>

<p>"Let's show 'em, Ted!" cried Janet.</p>

<p>And then and there, down on the ground
in the tent, while the crowd looked on, the
Curlytops put the two black poodles through
the tricks Tip and Top used to do.</p>

<p>"It begins to look as though there was
something in their claim," said the man who
had acted as the friend of Ted and Janet.</p>

<p>"Those are my dogs!" declared the Professor,
getting more and more angry. "Tell
me&mdash;what color were the poodles you had?"
he asked Janet and Ted.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well," Ted answered slowly, "Tip and
Top were white, except Tip had a little black
spot on the end of his tail, and Top had a
black spot on his head&mdash;on the top."</p>

<p>"There! What did I tell you?" cried the
Professor. "Their poodles were <i>white</i> and
mine are <i>black</i>! They can't be the same!
Here, King and Emperor!" he cried, and,
stooping down he made a grab for the little
dogs that were staying near Ted and Janet.</p>

<p>With barks and growls the poodles sprang
away from the angry man. And, as it happened,
the one the man had called "King"
ran against a pail of water that was near
the bottom of the platform. The pail was
upset and some of the water splashed over
the black dog.</p>

<p>Then a queer change took place. Instead
of being pure black, the poodle became
streaked black and white! The black color
began running out of its hair, and formed a
little inky pool on the ground beneath the
animal.</p>

<p>"Look! Look!" cried Janet, pointing.</p>

<p>"Those dogs were <i>colored</i> black&mdash;they're
white poodles dyed black!" cried the man
who had taken the part of the Curlytops.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span>
"Now what have you to say?" he asked the
animal trainer.</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;er&mdash;those dogs are mine! I don't
know who stained 'em black. But I bought
'em of a young man&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Was his name Shorty?" asked Ted.</p>

<p>"Well, maybe it was," admitted the showman.
"What has that got to do with it?
Those are my dogs!"</p>

<p>"They're ours!" insisted Ted. "Shorty
was watching our auto when Tip was stolen,"
he went on, "and he knew where we were
taking Top. I guess Shorty broke into our
barn the other night, and took Top and colored
him black. These are our poodles, and
we're going to have them!"</p>

<p>"It looks as though they had you, Professor,"
said the kind man.</p>

<p>"And we're going to get a policeman!"
added Janet.</p>

<p>"Oh, well, if you're sure they are your
dogs, take 'em!" growled the showman. "I
didn't know they were stolen. A young fellow
sold me one some time ago, and I bought
the other of him day before yesterday. I did
color the dogs black," he admitted, "because
they don't get so dirty as white ones. The
dye will wash off," he said. "If you are sure<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span>
these are your poodles, take 'em along!" he
said to Ted and Janet.</p>

<p>"Oh, we're sure all right!" cried Janet.
And then she took Top up in her arms, while
Teddy carried the partly black and partly
white Tip out of the tent, while the audience
laughed and some clapped.</p>

<p>"The show's over!" growled the black-moustached
man. "And if I get hold of that
Shorty I'll have him arrested for selling me
stolen dogs. They were valuable, too&mdash;as
good trick dogs as I ever saw. Do you want
to sell them to me?" he asked the Curlytops.</p>

<p>"No, sir!" cried Teddy and Janet as they
hurried out of the tent. "We're going to
have a circus of our own with 'em!"</p>

<p>And, happy and joyful, with the delighted
Tip and Top in their arms, the Curlytops
started for home.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span></p>
<h5>THE CURLYTOPS' CIRCUS</h5>

<p>Hurrying along, as if afraid that Professor
Montelli might run after them and take
Tip and Top away again, Teddy and Janet
went to the corner where they had left the
trolley car. Some boys and girls who had
been in the dog show followed the Curlytops,
and men and women smiled at the children.</p>

<p>"Here comes a car!" cried Ted, as he saw
one approaching. "Have we got enough
money left to take us home, Jan?" he asked,
for his sister had the cash.</p>

<p>"I guess so," she answered. "If we
haven't we'll ask the conductor please to
charge it."</p>

<p>The car stopped and with Janet holding
Top and Ted with Tip in his arms, the children
got aboard.</p>

<p>"Well, I see you got your dogs back,"
came a voice, and, looking up, the Curlytops<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span>
saw the same conductor they had ridden out
with from Cresco.</p>

<p>"I didn't think I'd have you back with
me so soon," he said. "But I'm glad to see
you. It's sort of against the rules to bring
dogs on trolley cars, but I guess yours will
be all right, as long as they're trick circus
dogs."</p>

<p>"Shall we make 'em do some tricks for
you?" asked Teddy, as he and his sister took
their seats.</p>

<p>"Well, not now, thank you," the conductor
answered, with a smile as the car started
off, leaving behind the curious crowd. "I'll
soon be so busy collecting fares that I won't
have time to watch."</p>

<p>"Then we'll send you a ticket to our circus,"
promised Janet, "'cause you were so
kind to us."</p>

<p>"Thank you," replied the conductor. "I
shall be glad to come. You can take my name
and mail the ticket to me at the car house.
I like animals," and he patted the heads of
Tip and Top. "But what makes one black,
and the other streaked black and white?" he
asked.</p>

<p>"They're colored, but it will wash off,"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span>
answered Ted. "The Professor, or maybe
Shorty, dyed our white poodles black."</p>

<p>You can imagine how surprised Mr. and
Mrs. Martin were when Ted and Janet came
in with the lost dogs&mdash;one black and the
other white and black.</p>

<p>"I was just going to telephone to the police
and have them start to look for you!"
cried their mother. "I was worried. Where
have you been?"</p>

<p>"To a dog show, where we found Tip and
Top," said Janet.</p>

<p>Then they told the whole story, and Mr.
and Mrs. Martin were much surprised at
what the Curlytops had done.</p>

<p>"As it was, you did just the right thing,"
said their father. "Though I wouldn't like
to have you do it again. However, I'm glad
you have your pets back, though Tip isn't
exactly a beauty."</p>

<p>"They'll be all right after they have had
a bath," said Janet.</p>

<p>And the poodles were, coming from the tub
as white as snow. Later it was learned that
the young man known as Shorty had not
really taken Tip from the automobile. But
he had gotten a chum of his to do it, and
afterward the two had sold the dog. They<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span>
sold him to Professor Montelli, who used to
have a side show with a circus, but who, after
a quarrel, started out for himself, traveling
around the country giving exhibitions.</p>

<p>Shorty, having heard the talk of the Martin
family while he was acting as guard of
the automobile load of pets, knew where Top
was being taken, to Cresco. And it was he
who broke into the barn and took away the
poodle. For, as I have told you, while one
dog was valuable for the tricks he could do,
the two, doing tricks together, were worth
much more.</p>

<p>Professor Montelli may not have known
the poodles were stolen, and he may, as he
said, have dyed them with harmless black
color to keep their white coats from getting
dirty. But the police said they thought the
dog trainer had a hand, with Shorty, in the
thefts, and this may have been so. At any
rate the Curlytops had their pet poodles
back, and they heard nothing more of Shorty
or the showman.</p>

<p>"And now we can give our circus!" cried
Janet one afternoon, when she and Teddy,
with Trouble, were feeding their pets in the
barn.</p>

<p>It did not take long to make arrangements<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span>
for the show. Jimmy Norton's father secured
a large tent for the Curlytops and their
friends, and the tent was set up in a lot not
far from the Martin house. Several boys
and girls helped make the arrangements, and
Mr. Martin sent up from the store a pile of
boxes and boards which some of his men
made into seats.</p>

<p>Mrs. Martin told the ladies who had asked
her to help raise money for the orphans that
the Curlytops were going to give all they
took in at the circus to help the poor children.
And when this became known many
grown folk, as well as boys and girls, bought
tickets for the performance.</p>

<p>It was to be given one afternoon, and you
can imagine all the work that had to be done
to get ready. But some of the fathers and
mothers of the chums of the Curlytops
helped, leaving to Ted and Janet the work
of getting the animals ready to do their
tricks. Jack Turton was to be a fat little
clown, riding on a pony his father had
bought for him. Harry Kent and some other
boys were to help Teddy, and some of Jan's
girl friends offered to help her.</p>

<p>And we must not forget Trouble. As arranged,
he was to come into the tent at a certain<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span>
time, driving Skyrocket, the dog, and
Turnover, the cat, hitched to his little express
wagon, with funny Miss Muffin on the
seat.</p>

<p>At last the day of the circus came. Into
the tent were moved the cages of the white
mice and the white rats, the tank containing
Slider, the pet alligator, the cage of Mr.
Nip, the parrot, and the box of Jack, the
monkey. Snuff, Skyrocket and Turnover
were on hand. Tip and Top were all ready
to perform their tricks.</p>

<p>"Do you think we'll have a big crowd?"
asked Janet of Ted, when everything was
arranged and it was almost time for the
show to begin.</p>

<p>"Sure we will!" he answered. "Everybody
I met is coming&mdash;all the fellows and
girls and a lot of men and women. We'll
make a lot of money for the orphans."</p>

<p>"I wish Uncle Toby could be here to see
it all," went on Janet, as she took a last look
inside the tent to make sure everything was
in order "He'd be surprised at some of
the things his pets can do."</p>

<p>"Yes, I wish Uncle Toby could be here,"
said her brother. "It's queer about him. He
never answered any of daddy's letters.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span>
South America must be a good way off, for
Uncle Toby hasn't gotten there yet."</p>

<p>"Well," began Ted. "I guess&mdash;&mdash;" and
then Harry Kent called:</p>

<p>"Hey, Ted! You'd better look at Slider!
He's trying to crawl out of his tank."</p>

<p>"It isn't time for him to start his act yet!"
answered the Curlytop boy. "I'll have to
give him a bit of meat to quiet him!"</p>

<p>And a little while after that the audience
began to enter the tent. Boys and girls, of
course, were the first, but there were a number
of men and women, too, and it was not
long before every seat was taken. Mr. and
Mrs. Martin just had to be there&mdash;they
couldn't stay away when the Curlytops were
giving a show. Besides, Mother Martin had
to help Trouble dress for his act.</p>

<p>"Oh, we're going to have a big crowd!"
said Janet excitedly to Teddy, in the little
dressing room behind the stage. There was
a stage almost like the one Professor Montelli
had in his dog show.</p>

<p>"You better go out and make your talk
now," went on Janet to her brother. "The
tent won't hold many more, and we want to
start."</p>

<p>"All right," agreed Teddy. It had been<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span>
decided that he was to make a little speech
of welcome. Soon he was out in front, bowing
as he did when he "spoke a piece" in
school.</p>

<p>"Ladies and gentlemen," began Teddy,
"and boys and girls. We're glad you came
to our circus, and we hope you will like our
pets and what they do. And my little
brother, Trouble, is going to do an act by
himself. He&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Here I is!" suddenly cried Trouble, coming
out behind Teddy. "I do my act now!"</p>

<p>"No! No!" said Teddy, while the audience
laughed. For Trouble was only half
dressed, having rushed out of the room back
of the stage when he heard his name mentioned.</p>

<p>"Here, William! Come back and let me
finish!" said his mother, and she reached out
her hand and pulled Trouble back to her.</p>

<p>"Now the show will start," Teddy finished,
amid laughter.</p>

<p>The first act was a tableau with Ted, Janet
and their boy and girl helpers, not forgetting
Trouble, of course, posing on the stage
with their pets. Gathered about the children
were the dogs, the cats, Mr. Nip, the
parrot, Jack the monkey, the white mice and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span>
the white rats in cages, and Slider, the pet
alligator. Down in the audience Harry
Weldon played the mouth organ. He was the
"orchestra."</p>

<p>No sooner had Harry started to play than
Tip, Top and Skyrocket barked, the cats
mewed, the monkey chattered and Mr. Nip
cried:</p>

<p>"I'm a crack-crack-cracker!"</p>

<p>You should have heard the audience clap
then!</p>

<p>One after another the animals did their
tricks, Ted, Janet and the other boys and
girls helping. Mr. Nip, the parrot, after he
had been quieted down, walked up and down
a little ladder, that was balanced like a see-saw
over a tiny board. Mr. Nip would walk
to one end of the ladder, and it would go
down with him. Then he would walk to the
other end, which would then sway downward.
And when he had finished this trick Mr. Nip
cried:</p>

<p>"Help! Fire! Police!" and flew over on
Janet's shoulder.</p>

<p>"He's as good as a watch dog, that parrot
is," said Policeman Cassidy, who had come
to the show, as had also the kind trolley car<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span>
conductor. "He's a regular burglar alarm,
he is!"</p>

<p>Snuff and Turnover did their tricks, some
separately and some together. One of the
tricks they did together was to run and jump
through a paper hoop, and when Turnover
had landed on the other side, through the
hoop, he lay down and rolled over and over&mdash;one
of the first tricks the Curlytops had
taught their pet.</p>

<p>Again the audience clapped and laughed.
But there was more to come. Tip and Top
did the tricks for which they were famous,
separately and together, one dog walking on
his hind legs, and the other turning somersaults.
Then one dog got on the other's
back, the two going around the stage together.
And as a climax they did the trick
by which Ted and Janet had recognized their
pets in Professor Montelli's tent, one dog
leaping over the other's back, while moving
along.</p>

<p>"Now, Jan, you do your trick with the
white mice and the alligator while Harry
Kent and I fix up the tower for Jack to jump
from," said Ted. "And Jack can do his
clown tricks, too."</p>

<p>It had been decided that while Teddy and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span>
his helper were putting in place the tower
for the monkey to leap from something must
be done to amuse the audience.</p>

<p>So Janet had said she would do some
little tricks with the mice, rats, and alligator,
while Harry, the fat little boy clown, would
turn somersaults and handsprings on the
stage.</p>

<p>This went off very well. Janet fixed the
slanting board for Slider to coast "down
hill," and when the alligator had done this
the audience laughed its hardest. Then some
of the rats and mice did simple tricks, two
of the larger rats pulling a little toy wagon
in which rode two mice.</p>

<p>However, these pets did not do as well as
the others, for the two in the wagon kept
jumping out and Janet had to keep putting
them back.</p>

<p>Jack, the fat little clown, made a big
"hit." He was really very funny, and when,
toward the end of his act, he got too near the
edge of the stage and fell into the lap of
big Oscar North, the audience thought it was
all part of the show, and not an accident,
and clapped most loudly. However, Jack
was not hurt, and only laughed at the mishap.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span></p>

<p>By this time the tower was ready. It
reached nearly to the top of the tent, and as
the boxes had been covered with green
branches they made a nice appearance.</p>

<p>"Up, Jack! Up!" called Ted, climbing
up the stepladder and placing the banana
on top of the tower. Then Ted had to hurry
the ladder away, after Jack had climbed up
to the top, for fear the monkey would climb
down that same way instead of jumping as
he was wanted to do.</p>

<p>Ted and Harry Kent held the net at the
foot of the tower. This time the net was
not a lace curtain, but some old bags sewed
together. Janet held up the bit of banana,
and, after he had eaten the piece on top of
his perch, the monkey looked down at the
other bit of fruit.</p>

<p>"Come on, Jack! Jump!" cried Teddy.</p>

<p>And to the delight of the Curlytops, Jack
jumped his very best, landing in the net and
bouncing up and down.</p>

<p>"Good trick! Good trick!" cried the trolley
car conductor, clapping the loudest of all.</p>

<p>After that Jack did a number of other
simple tricks, and then it was time for
Trouble to come on in his act. Only a few
knew what the little fellow was to do. But<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span>
when the curtains on the stage were pulled
apart by Mrs. Martin and the little fellow
walked out, dressed like the pictures of Cupid
on valentines, driving the dog and cat
harnessed to the wagon, with queer Miss
Muffin on the seat, you should have heard
the people laugh and clap!</p>

<p>"Didap! Didap!" cried Trouble to his
dog and cat team. "Didap an' go fast!"</p>

<p>Around the stage went Skyrocket and
Turnover, behaving very nicely; and when he
had made one round Trouble stood in the
middle of the stage and made a low bow, as
his mother had taught him to do.</p>

<p>"He's a cute little chap!" said Policeman
Cassidy.</p>

<p>And then came the last scene of all, where
Ted, Janet, Trouble and their boy and girl
helpers, with all the pets, except the parrot,
alligator and rats and mice, marched around
the stage, while the mouth organ was loudly
played.</p>

<p>"That's the end of the show! Much
obliged to you all for coming!" called out
Teddy.</p>

<p>"And let's see how much we made for the
orphans!" exclaimed Janet, before any of
the audience had a chance to leave.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span></p>

<p>There was a laugh at this.</p>

<p>"You did very well, Curlytops, and
Trouble also," said Mrs. Martin, as the children
began to take off their costumes, for
they had all dressed especially for the occasion.</p>

<p>"I never thought the pets would act so
well," added Mr. Martin.</p>

<p>"And did we make much money?" Janet
wanted to know.</p>

<p>Mr. Martin was counting it. As he
dropped the last penny back into the cash
box he announced:</p>

<p>"It is ninety-nine dollars and one cent."</p>

<p>"Well, here's ninety-nine cents to make it
an even hundred dollars!" cried a jolly voice
at the tent entrance, and in walked a man
who seemed to be a stranger. But at the second
look Mr. Martin cried:</p>

<p>"Uncle Toby!"</p>

<p>"Yes, Uncle Toby!" laughed the man. "I
got here a little too late for the show, but
you can give it over again for me, and I'll
put as much again in the collection box as
you have there. How are all my pets?" and
he laughed again and looked at the Curlytops
as well as at the animals.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span></p>

<p>"We're well, thank you," said Janet,
shyly.</p>

<p>"And Tip and Top were taken away but
we got them back," added Ted.</p>

<p>"An' Mr. Nip he catch a bu'glar!" lisped
Trouble.</p>

<p>"My! My! There must have been a lot
of excitement while I have been gone!"
laughed Uncle Toby, for it was, indeed, he.</p>

<p>"When did you get back from South
America?" asked Mr. Martin.</p>

<p>"I didn't go," answered Uncle Toby. "I
got all ready to go, but changed my mind and
went to Canada instead. I'm going back to
live in my old house."</p>

<p>"And will you&mdash;will you take your pets?"
asked Teddy.</p>

<p>"Well, not right away," answered Uncle
Toby. "You may keep them as long as you
like. I wish I had been here for the show,
but here's the ninety-nine cents I promised,
and if you give the show for me later on I'll
give a hundred dollars for the orphans."</p>

<p>"Oh, how lovely!" cried Janet. "Let's
start and give it now!"</p>

<p>It was, however, a little too late in the
day for that. But, a week later, Uncle Toby
did see all the pets put through their tricks<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span>
and he gave another hundred to the orphan
fund, so that many of the poor children had
a fine vacation time in the country.</p>

<p>"Well, we certainly had a lot of fun with
all the animals," said Janet one day, when
she and Teddy were playing out under the
trees with the dogs and the cats.</p>

<p>"Yes," he agreed, "we did. We had as
much fun this summer as if we had gone
away. And I wonder what we can do next?"</p>

<p>"Oh, something, I guess," said Janet.
"What I'm going to do now is go in and
get something to eat."</p>

<p>"I'm a crack-crack-cracker!" shrieked
Mr. Nip from his perch.</p>

<p>"Well, I want something more than
crackers!" laughed Janet.</p>

<p>"So do I!" agreed Teddy. "We'll get
some bread and jam and also feed our pets.
I guess they're hungry, too."</p>

<p>And while the Curlytops are thus engaged
we will say good-bye to Janet, Teddy and
Trouble.</p>
